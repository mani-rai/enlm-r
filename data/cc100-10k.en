Belmont Estate is on the market for $63 million and boasts roughly 22,000 square feet of luxurious finishes and elaborate architecture on 1.28 acres. Listed on Thursday, the home is being sold by high-end real estate firm Sotheby’s International Realty Canada.
“Within the city we’ve had homes that have sold for $56 million, $33 million, $31 million but this will be the record of the offering price,” listing agent Christa Frosch of Sotheby’s tells BuzzBuzzNews.
The three-storey home has five bedrooms, twelve bathrooms and an elevator in the west wing. Built to entertain, two main gallery halls can seat up to 100 guests. The Italian-inspired kitchen includes a fireplace and walls and ceilings throughout the home feature murals and artwork. Lavish amenities include an indoor pool and sauna, a six-car garage and a private entrance in-law’s suite.
Surrounding the property is a Versailles-inspired garden with a variety of trees, plants and an orchard. In the spring, over 12,000 flowers bloom in the tiered, three-level garden.
According to Frosch, the listing has received global attention and, despite being on the market for only 24 hours, buyers are already showing interest.
“We just went to the market yesterday, it’s private through Sotheby’s and we’ve already started to get calls,” says Frosch.

Stay well hydrated—that means you should include about 48- 64 ounces of liquid (non-calorie) each day. You will be drinking small amounts (“sips”) every hour through the day since you will not be able to drink a large amount all at once.
On Day Four after your surgery, begin adding liquid protein during this Phase (20 to 30 grams per day). That means you should buy a protein powder suggested by your dietitian, doctor or nurse. We recommend:.
Unjury (20grams of whey protein isolate per packet) once a day (available at our office or www.UNJURY.com or 800-517-5111.
Watch for signs of dehydration!
Review protein sources: meats, chicken, turkey, eggs, cheese, low fat milk, yogurt, tofu, soy beans, other legumes (beans).
You may use baby food without added sugar or starch such as baby food chicken, no blends such as chicken and rice.
You can eat fruits without sugar or syrup.
You may use a blender or food processor to keep foods soft.
Introduce new foods slowly and one at a time.
For extra protein add powdered milk (1/4 c) to your 1 cup of skim milk (this give about 18 grams of protein).
Taking vitamins will become a daily part of your life after gastric bypass surgery. We recommend:.
Calcium Citrate, 1500 mg in 3 divided doses with Vitamin D 3 (2000 IU per day).
Continue to eat a high protein food at each meal such as lean meat or chicken.
(50 grams of protein for women/ 60 grams for men), lean ground turkey is good choice for this phase.
Use skim milk as a protein source (2 cups per day).
Get your lab work at 3 months, 6 months 1 year and yearly after surgery.
See your surgeon for regular check-ups and lab work.
Call or e-mail the nurse or dietitian if you have questions 412-741-8862.
Hi, I'm Rudy. It will be ten years on June 21, 2014 I started on a remarkable journey; I had gastric bypass surgery.
Five months before that day, I was at my primary care physician's and he asked me if I ever thought of having bypass surgery. I never gave it a thought. I was on three blood pressure medications, cholesterol medicine, and 100 units of insulin every day. I had trouble breathing, just walking up a slight grade I had to use an inhaler.
Surgery went well. Recovery didn't take long and I was eating real food. I've been around 180 lbs. for 10 years now. I went from a 44 inch waist to a 34 inch waist. I feel strong and I have a lot more energy.
I don't use an inhaler anymore. I'm off all my blood pressure medications, cholesterol medicine and I went from 100 units of insulin down to 20 units of insulin a day.
At my heaviest, I weighed 283 lbs. and I have managed to keep 100 lbs. off for 10 years.
One thing I've learned is that I can leave food on my plate when I'm full.

Travelling alone can be a daunting prospect, not least to attend a wedding alone. The original plan had been to go with another neighbour, but she slipped a disc in her back and was unable to fly. Having fully absorbed the message from our esteemed Minister for Disabled People that everywhere is now fully accessible and disabled people don't need any extra money to pay for that perfect access I wasn't put off by such trivial concerns and on thursday I went to Ireland to see my lovely neighbour marry in her home town of Swinford.
Despite Maria's assurances of perfect access it seemed to take me much more time to arrange my travel and be more expensive than for the other guests. Travel Insurance cost double the standard amount, then there was arranging support at each airport before I went, which could only be confirmed on a 10p a minute phone line. The Bride had booked a hotel with access for the reception, in which I had to stay because whilst all the cheaper accomodation 'just over the road' was within comfortable drunken stumbling distance it certainly wasn't within any kind of deathwalking distance.
My neighbour had booked an accessible mini bus to take us from the airport to hotel which we eventually managed to find after a somewhat disturbing Mrs Robinson moment. There was a very attractive young man who looked in his early 20's on the flight who was also going to the wedding, who helped with my bag. I began to think it might be great fun until he told me had never flown alone before and his mum hadn't given him any money for the mini bus at which point I felt like a paedophile!
The mini bus journey was similar to the flight...with the added smell of old diesel for ambience. We all sat, in somewhat shell shocked silence, fighting the urge to vomit. Eventually we got to the hotel in Westport and then it got really tricky. But, I was in Ireland...so I offered up my prayers to Maria. I knew she'd fix it.
I'm really glad I got to see the bride and groom on their big day, but I can't help feeling that Maria really let me down. I had such faith in her, she tells us all often enough that everything's great and well...it kind of wasn't great. More a bit crap really. So next time I think I can travel alone, without any support I'll have to remember Maria and her magical misleading missives.
*Apologies to the people of Kerry who I'm sure are all very nice.
If its any consolation, the Irish have Kerry-men as the but of all their jokes, with good reason.
Excellent post Kaliya, very well written. Sorry things didn't go better for you, not that it's not expected to anyway. This needs to be read by all in government, not that it would make any difference though. Loved your come back to Mr. offensive, don't know that I would have been so polite; TV and billboards need to run a campaign on educating people to the different disabilities and especially invisible disabilities, so sad that in this day and age there is so much ignorance around.
Thanks for posting this. I forget how sheltered I am by having a hubby in tow - or, no, what actually happens is that I conveniently blank out how hideous things were whenever he couldn't be there.
For our wedding we tried relatively hard to ensure accessibleness for our wheelchair using guest, although being in a listed building meant he couldn't get upstairs for the marriage ceremony. We visited the accommodation (100 yards away on the flat from the reception venue), measured it, photographed it, judged it according to the very useful criteria you have posted. But he declined to come, because he'd had such a horrendous time visiting other 'accessible' venues and finding out they weren't really.
He just couldn't risk the health consequences of turning up to find things weren't actually as he needed them. This is why it's such a tragedy that accessibility isn't thought through from the perspective of what people really need.
YOu look so beautiful (Then again you would look beautiful in sack cloth lol).
I rarely go out now - since i had my sticked kicked out from under me and the time they refused to sit down in a closed cafe in the local mall, since then my life has got smaller and smaller.
So life is very small. Friends are nowhere to be found and I wonder what I did to get this.
But - I am still alive at the moment so that is a plus, I love my family, and I live vicariously through others who blog LOLOL.
I love you taking us with you on your adventures thorugh the accessible world of the UK...
Hope you are OK and have got over the stress of your trip now <3.
Ah, now I understand the 'Ireland didn't go well' comment in your email earlier! Poor you, that wasn't much fun at all. I expect you were relieved to be home and on 'terra firma'!!
No extra costs for access? Asking for a disabled access hack if I want to take my chair (Quickie Ti - weighs little, I can just pick it up and put it in, no need for time-consuming ramps), to the pub here in Wirral jacks up the normal fair by about £1.50.
Not so, though, if I don't have my chair. Clearly discriminatory.
You should do a Rough Guide version of international travel!
The rude drunk - a classic example. I too admire your dignity in the face of adversity.
Katie price has tweeted for models all shapes or sizes! are you going to give it a go for all young disabled people as you certainly do sparkle. Just a thought?
Think she is becoming aware of all drawbacks as parents and herself are having to set up schmo as Harvey's is closing and they want the pupils to stay together cos of friendships and routine, as we all know how especially this is important.
Dear me, what an ordeal; you looked great though!
I miss the holidays, but I've accepted it now. I can't risk the knock on effect of months of even worse health than usual.
You were very brave to do what you did!
If you ever want to prove him wrong,I'm right here Bendy,at the back of this very long queue :D.

He attracts all these girls who are over obsessed with him, HE IS JUST A 16 YEAR OLD BOY, he is human and no different to us boys. So why are girls obsessed with him!
Im a 15 year old boy, he also annoys me due to the fact that his boxers are always showing, do you know this originated from PRISON, guys used to pull there trousers too under their butt to show that they are free and wanting anul s*x.
I'm g*y and have awesome gaydar. Kids a little q***r. As for him dating a girl...It's called playing straight. Did it for 5 years myself. It's the easiest game to play. Either way. Listen to real music that talks about real issues, not petty adolesent emotions. Dare to think think for yourself rather than eat the force fed s**t that everyone likes. I hope some of you are smarter than you appear to be..
people have there facts all wrong,his a boy not a girl,he never used those things which change your voice he just got better at it,he's nice,kind,sweet,awsome,cool,a great singer and caring,and that he is american and canadian,haven't you watched tv that you can be a person of two countries.
-In all of his music videos, he portays himself at American. The American flag, the American dream, etc. I find it insulting he seems to want to hide his nationalistic pride for his home country (and mine), Canada.
-He flaunts all of his more famous associates and uses them as credibility.
-He pretends to be an activist for g*y rights, when he hides his own bisexuality from the press. (He is in fact bisexual. Ask anyone who knew him from before he became famous.).
-He uses voice enhancers (aka autotuners) for recordings and concerts. He is not as good a singer as many believe him to be (if you don't believe this, compare his early youtube uploads to his current songs).
2. he cant control that, so its pretty low.
and yeah im a boy,and no, im not g*y, im a nice guy. i dont love his songs or anything , but he's not that bad tbh.
he's an insult to real music. autotune does not mean you can sing well.
I don't think he's g*y I just don't like him:.
-He is 16... how does he even know what love is all about or have the life experience to back it up?
Also... just cause guys call him g*y in no way means that they are jealous of Justin Bieber, we just don't see what the big deal with him is... also all the Justine Bieber fans who were upset about Arcade Fire getting best album at the Grammy's instead of Justin Bieber needs to calm. If you haven't heard Arcade Fire's album and you don't know it... then don't complain that J.B. should have won.... We've heard his stuff and don't like it... might as well widen your musical boundaries a little, eh? (I'm from Michigan, not Canada).
Anyway that's my reasoning... agree with me or not, that's just how I feel.
1) he HAS hit puberty. listen to his recent songs.
4) he got a haircut and he looks soo much better.
Back to the subject. he has completed more things already than most people do in their life time! And its just the beginning.
And by the way EVERY sing guy in this world thinks about girls and wants girls. Hes just like every other guy.
I'm a girl but I don't like him that much.
1. He hasn't got puberty and he's 16.
2. If he still hasn't got it, he acts like he's 20 and sings about girls which is annoying and weird for his age type.
3. He has only girl fans OBVIOUSLY. Only 1 or 2 boys around the world or even none like him. He is unpopular and people are his fans cause they way he looks. DUMB.
5. He doesn't have a sponser. He should be by disney or something.
The reasons could be as many as you can just think about because when you are drawing others fan's towards you then must definitely the competitive environment will be alarmingly high and same goes here with Justin Drew Bieber.
2 you hear him every freaking day on a commercial he reminds me of a girl singer or alvin and the chipmunks.
3 i dont really hate g**s but can you compare the way they talk act and what they sound like and they share many similarities?
4why do you even like him? he doesnt look hot. he thinks he can rap with people who can. i respect real rappers. if i were him i would be imbarrassed to try to be a rapper even though im not that good at rapping.
i think i have made my point i dont hate him,its just i think he is making so many wrong choices leading him in random success.
People are annoying. Don't listen to them. Guys do it cause their just JEALOUS of him and his sexiness, hotness, and his hair. They just call him that because of those things. THEY MAKE ME MADDDDD!
4 reasons why people hate justin bieber.
He has the voice of a chipmunk.
we are not JEALOUS because he has no talent so wat is there to be jealous of??
that is why i hate justin bieber.
h**l if I know if he is g*y or not, just a little bit odd. Mostly I just hate his music, a bunch of sing-about-love stuff again. I get enough of that from way to many places. But I, in general, hate alot of what play on a couple radio stations around me, so its not really targeted right at beiber.
His music is symbolic of the complete commercialization of modern pop music.
It's music made simply for a quick profit.
If you like it you've never listened to real music made for the purpose of sounding good.
Why dont you just become a walking billboard for pepsi and get it over with?
g*y is used as a derrogatory term which is not the same as homosexual.
i dont think he is g*y i just dont like the fact he didnt have to work to become famous.
Boys think Justin is g*y because they are attracted to him. Girls like Bieber because he appears to be gentle and delicate in handling women. All of you haters die with agonizing pain of jealousy, none of you can do any harm to how females think of him. Learn to respect people and mean it from the heart, you might also get someone to like you.
ACTUALLY!! he admitted himself he was g*y, umm no hes not smart, he ran into a glass door, hmm lets see what else, umm he started his own nail polish brand which comes out in a couple weeks, i think that pretty much says it all right their!!
Lets start with..He has no talent and his voice can pass for a girl..Which I guess is fine considering girls dig Jonas Brother, Zac Effron, etc. Have fun with that. Stop defending someone who's a 1-year sensation and get a life.
Justin serenaded wonderful or better than a great I like popular songs, particularly as it is talented. all those who hate Justin are g**s because they feel jealous of him because he is handsome at the same time a rising singer and a small age. I myself appreciate the wonderful artist with this beautiful and talented .
I think all guys hate him because guys have completely different taste in music and his voice is like girl but he is a little boy growing now, when he is 18/20 years old, his voice grow up a regular guy but the secret I love you and his music.
some guys might be jealous because all the pre-teen girls want him, but guess what? THEY CAN'T HAVE HIM. in 2 years nobody will care, his songs are f*****g repetitive. have you listened to baby? 80% of the song is just him saying "baby" and he sounds like a chick and acts like a "gangsta" i'm not jealous its just getting old. all you hear about is Justin Bieber and how he's so awesome and he hasn't done anything for society. when we could focus on other important"er" s**t.

A thread to brag about your current piercings, Tattoos and how/if they contribute to sex or make you feel sexy. Also a place to inform people of the crazy things one can do they're bodies :).
Hopefully other people have something to brag about too, Thanks.
You can find a thread on piercings here - http://www.lovehoney.co.uk/community/forums/sex-tips-and-talk/9771-piercings/page-27/.
It's helpful to have a search above to see if any threads like this have been posted before, just so we don't end up with multiple threads of the same topic. Hope it helps :) x.
I also have a tattoo on my lower back that looks like a cross and my current oh likes to use it as a target practice!
Just to show we are all different, don't like any of the above a woman's body is A beautiful enough thing to not need anything to enhance it.
Just my opinion, it's your body to do with as you wish.
Weird thing is that I'm pretty scared of needles.
I've had the PA for over a decade now so my wife and I don't really notice it that much any more, I still like having it though and like the way or looks. I've had up to an 8mm thick ring in it but have come back down to 5mm which I prefer.
It's more an adrenaline thing for me, rather than enhancing it.. Kinda get a kick outta it.. ;).
Would love some tatts, but too much of a wimp to get them! 😥.
Only my ear was pierced, but has pretty much sealed now after I fell out of love with it.
I have always wanted to get my nipples pierced but I have no money to do it for the moment. Also I am afraid I couldn't let them heal correctly as my man would probably want to play with them straight away!
I have no tattoos and I have a few piercings.
I love mine and I feel so much better when I am wearing them. I would like a tattoo but I want to wait for something I know I will love.
I had one of those once, but the ex just thought it felt strange so I got rid lol. To be fair it was pretty bulky whilst I was wearing it too...I'm sure women would get more of a kick out of them though!
I have 2 tattoos, self designed :) And I have my nose and ears pierced. None of them really contribute to sex, but one of my tattoos has my boyfriend's initials in ogham writing and is below my hipbone (normally under my knickers unless I wear something really flimsy) which he thinks is sexy :).
Would love to get my tongue done (bf is up for that!) but worried about it affecting my teeth.
I love getting piercings, and I'm pretty fond of them once they're in and healed, but...
Healing them is the worst for me. I tend to yank them out sitting still (I have NO idea how I pulled a nose screw out on thin air), never mind in sexy time.... I've had to retire three partially healed helixes in the past two years because of this, and haven't bothered to get any more as such.
I have both nostrils done, and my septum. Depending on what course I end up on next month, I'm thinking of my forward helix again.
We're not so rough and over the top these days, so they miiiiight survive ._.

In 1971, we believed in a dream. We believed there must be a better way. When you dream a little, common people, working together, can do uncommon things.
Quad is the embodiment of one man's dream to find a better way.
With a $35,000 second mortgage on his home and capital raised from a handful of people who believed in him – and 11 co-founders who made a courageous leap of faith – Harry launched Quad/Graphics on July 13, 1971.
We haven’t been given more opportunities; we’ve just made more of the opportunities presented to us.
A can-do attitude leads to rapid-fire growth.
Those first years were lean and print contracts were few. But with perseverance and what we like to call a can-do attitude — a characteristic that continues to distinguish us from other printers — the fledgling company hung on. We slowly gained business, primarily when no other printer would take the work.
The turning point came in 1977, when we started printing work for Newsweek. The popular national publication was sold on our groundbreaking ideas and entrepreneurial spirit, but above all, they trusted in us. Newsweek put us on the map as a high-quality, innovative print services provider.
Rapid-fire expansion continued across the country, matched with investments in the industry’s most advanced equipment and technology.
Along the way, we also founded the industry’s first and only dedicated research and development subsidiary, set up a network of imaging sites and photography studios, created innovative solutions for our clients (including mailing and distribution breakthroughs like the industry’s first and largest co-mailing technology), picked up awards for printer of the year, best place to work and environmental stewardship, and established a global presence through international partnerships in Latin America, India and Europe.
All of us who come after Harry must take what he created and push it forward, push it beyond, what he ever hoped it could be.
A new generation of visionary leadership.
When we unexpectedly lost Harry in July 2002, many thought the company would collapse without his leadership. He was, after all, an industry icon. But we persevered – and prospered.
As we continue to transform our company and our industry, we are at the ready. Quad powered. Quad Proud.
With a broader global footprint and wider range of capabilities, we could now reach more clients with more solutions.
Prudent acquisitions such as these support our ongoing strategy to transform both our company and the industry – all while adding value for our clients, shareholders and employees. Acquisitions are made with an eye to advancing technologies, capabilities and efficiencies that help our clients drive top-line revenue and minimize overall costs.
As a result of the game-changing Worldcolor acquisition, Quad became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange on July 6, 2010. The steady hand of the Quadracci family retains voting control, and continues to provide consistency in ownership, leadership and strategy.
We are proud printers, innovating all aspects of our company and our industry.
Today, Quad is a leading global provider of print and media solutions. Our remarkable growth is powerful testament to our inimitable culture, visionary leadership team and employees worldwide who take pride in their work and are wholly invested in the success of our clients – and our company.
Working together, we are driven to find a better way – and to deliver on our promise of Performance through Innovation.
As a company, we adapt to change – in fact, more often than not, we are the change. Where others see challenges, we see opportunities. We’re a high-tech company, but we succeed the old-fashioned way: through honesty, integrity, hard work, doing the right thing and always putting our clients first.

The 2016 Pulitzer Prizes will be announced April 18 at 3pm ET. Because the names of the finalists are not released ahead of time, the winner is a surprise every year. But for nine years we have been posting a prediction list prepared by a fellow Pulitzer collector and research scientist. The list is the product of a regression analysis that weighs a given book's performance in other book awards, as well as the author's past award and nomination history.
Comment on our lists, or offer your own opinion about who you think will win the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction:.
I'm basing this on a list on Goodreads.com. I've not been successful at finding a list of selections on the Powell's website itself.
Humility and grace are becoming dinosaurs. Can't wait to read the book now simply based upon the merit of the author's character.
No but it's listed on the pulitzer website (when they announce the winners).
did anyone post who was on the jury?
@zacharybloomzooey @ey814 I don't operate the PPrize site, but although I don't think there is general opposition to that, I know the site moderator has his hands full keeping up with the tasks around the fiction awards... but, I'll let him respond if that's a possibility.
Tom, you are a saint. I can confirm they do ship, very friendly and helpful. And I now have a first printing on its way! Thank you!
@ejcrowe42 Not sure about Greenlight, but it was a Book Passage First Edition Club selection, which is how I got my copy. Which compels me to point out that the Pulitzer winner for each of the past four years has been a selection by at least one of the three FECs I subscribe to (Odyssey, Book Passage, Powell's). Not to mention this year's National Book Award winner (Odyssey).
I wanted to share an idea. Could we make a second thread about the Pulitzer Prizes in the other arts categories (general non-fiction, drama, and biography, history)?
If anyone is still looking for a first printing, Diane's Books in Greenwich CT had a pile of five first printings when I checked today at 12:45 ET. They sell them for regular price, and probably will ship.
@JpCambert @AlexKerner It was a finalist in general non-fiction! So that's cool!
@ey814 @ejcrowe42 @mrbenchly Haven't read it yet. It was on my radar last year, and we tried to get an event with the author, but Grove couldn't work it out, and then when Viet was back in the states in the fall, there were no more first printings and we didn't pursue it any further.
That may explain why there are pre-pub-dated copies floating around. Grove doesn't usually hold with strict on sale dates, and we were told that the author wasn't really going to be stateside after the publication date, so Viet signed books as available in certain bookstores.
Thanks to everyone who runs this site! It's always a pleasure! Two debuts in the running this year and some surprises! Always exciting!
Congratulations to Viet Thanh Nguyen and all of the other 2016 Pulitzer Prize winners. And to all of you who post frequently on this site, keep up the good work.
Congrats to The Sympathizer! Deft, well written, tight plot and intriguing narrator. I'm not surprised that it was recognized, however, on a personal note I was rooting for Tsar.
Emily - thanks for your comments and keep up the great work at Odyssey. Although I am not a member of your firsts club, I do frequent your website to see what your store as picked, given its excellent track record. I believe I ordered Marra's Constellation and Meyer's The Son in the same shipment a couple of summers ago :) This summer sounds like a blockbuster for you guys; I should go ahead and call in an order!
@BRAKiasaurus @AlexKerner @ey814 I actually have the Kelly Link book in paperback, and would never have dreamed it would be a contender, let alone finalist.
@AndrewBoston Looking forward to reading The Sympathizer, and thanks for being part of the PPrize community!
@Guardiands Yes, copies will begin to appear online (ebay or through abebooks.com or similar online dealers). Initially, they'll be priced really high and will sell, but eventually the price will settle. I think with 50,000 of them out there, still a good chance to get one without paying way too much. The first print run of ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE was 62,500, and there are copies to be had at $50 still.
@kas1985 With 50,000 out there, one will surface, probably without having to pay a premium, though it will demand more now than it did five hours ago :-).
The accuracy of this list is almost as amazing as the enjoyment in discussing it. Thank you very much for all you do.
I would like to know this as well. I had been looking for a first printing of "The Sympathizer " for several months leading up to the announcement, without success. In fact, it is one of only two from the top 15 list here that I did not own first printings of at the time of the announcement.
Do you happen to know its initial print run?
Secondly, thank you to everyone that makes this site possible, I am not a collector, but the recommendations have led me to some of the best books I read this past year.
One last thing; the model is kind of amazing bc once again the winner was in the top 10. It's all about the science behind the art.
I love a good war novel so I'm excited to give this one my all.
Unexpected for sure. I checked it out from the library/started it, but had to return before I finished. The last evacuation happened in April so kind of fitting. PBS did an excellent documentary marking that anniversary last year. 'Matterhorn' was also phenomenal. I tried to read 'Get in Trouble' but it was too out there for me. Haven't even heard of Maud's Line' but will look into that one. Thanks again for an awesome year everyone!!
I read about half of the Kelly Link book. While I'm happy for her ( she lives in my area and I know her a little), it never would have been on my radar for this award. And MAUD'S LINE? I've never heard of.
Happy for SYMPATHIZER. Guess this means I have to read it now. :-).
And one more year the winner was one of the books on the list.
I want to read the Sellout and Delicious foods and i don't know if they will be published here (The Sellout won the NBCC which should be enough to be published, but Billy Lynn's long half time walk is still unpublished here, of course it happens the same with The good lord bird and the NBA winners usually get published).
I suppose A little life will be published anyway, and given Bill Clegg's connections Did you ever have a family will be published for sure.
I suppose The Sympathizer won't be published as fast as The Goldfinch or All the light we can not see, and i will have to wait, it happened the same with The orphan master's son.
@OneMoreBook Agree--I love a surprise!
@AlexKerner Huh? Never heard of either... did anyone talk about these?
The Sympathizer is the author's first novel, if I'm not mistaken.
@ey814 Wow! I have a first edition at home, but I haven't read it yet...I wanna know the finalists too!
@JohnZ Best book I've read all year--and I've read most of the big names, I think.
@JpCambert @AlexKerner It is non-fiction, but you are correct: it deserves a pulitzer prize.
@AlexKerner @JpCambert I stand corrected. I was under the impression it was a fictionalized memoir from father to son while reading it.
@JpCambert Between the World and Me wouldn't be in the fiction category.
My predictions (talk about last minute) are as follows:.
I would like to thank everyone for another awesome year!!! It has been a year for books. Thanks for making and maintaining the lists. I think I'm going to have to go with 'A Little LIfe,' 'Eileen' and 'Fortune Smiles' as being somewhere in there. I wouldn't mind seeing Marra's book walk away with it either. I cannot commit this year at all.
@Guardiands Did You Ever Have a Family was one of my favorite novels published last year. It would be wonderful to see it recognized.
I don't comment on here except usually at this late stage of the game. I love doing my final predictions.
The last couple of years I've done pretty terribly. I haven't correctly predicted a winner since Jennifer Egan's (I hadn't read The Orphan Master's Son when it won, but it has since become one of my favorite books, period). I was proud to correctly predict Bob Shacochis's nomination for The Woman Who Lost Her Soul, Nathan Englander's What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank and Chang-Rae Lee's The Surrendered in recent years.
Because of my passion for two of these works I'm slightly afraid to predict them, but here goes:.
@JohnZ I didn't mention Welcome to Braggsville. I've been reading it lately, and I think it too stands a chance of being noticed.
Very insightful post, that was a pleasure to read. i felt the same as you about Fortune Smiles, and agree with your critique of A little Life. I know Did you ever have Family has gotten mixed reviews on here, but I wouldn't mind seeing that win.
About a day and a half to go before the 2016 Pulitzer winners are announced. There seems to be nothing that is a solid lock. I haven't read all of the books purportedly in the running, but there are a few which I think may receive some consideration.
The Sellout is a sharp and biting satire in which Mr. Beatty walks a tightrope between outrageous hilarity and profound contemplation on themes that run the gamut. It wouldn't be the first comic novel to win the Pulitzer, but I wonder if the jury and board will go for it. Who knows? It might well win the prize.
The Tsar of Love and Techno shows that A Constellation of Vital Phenomena was no fluke. Mr. Marra's voice is level and distinct, and in the seeming simplicity of its prose lies much complexity. I wouldn't be surprised to see it named as a winner or a finalist.
Fates and Furies has some lovely prose, but as others have observed, the story itself is a bit insular. It does have those moments in which details are presented in a striking manner, which is something it has in common with a number of Pulitzer winners. Ms. Groff is a very good writer, and though she's been nominated elsewhere for this novel, she has yet to win a prize or award. So it might well be another finalist or winner.
And what of The Sympathizer? Viet Thanh Nguyen writes with a sharp eye and ear for human beings caught in extraordinary circumstances. He has been compared to Graham Greene, George Orwell, and Denis Johnson -- and those three aren't too shabby (ha ha). It wouldn't surprise me if this novel was a finalist, maybe even a winner.
And then, as sometimes happens, we might get thrown a curveball by the Pulitzer board and jury. They've done it before. Who's to say it won't happen again?
Really, I have no set idea on what will win come Monday. As always, I'm interested to find out.
I'd be very interested in your sci-fi recommendations!
@Mstexexec I'll see if I can get a copy from the library! :) I have a few other books queued up to read, but I'll give it a shot!
Thank you for the response. I would love to have reactions to this book from other on this site to see how my opinions fit with more expert opinions. BRAK I intend to check out many of the books you listed as well.
@Mstexexec I haven't read this book, but the cover looks familiar.
@jfieds2 I agree with so much of what you described. I am still pulling for A Little Life but I am half way through Tsar and if it wins, I will be just as happy. Personally I have no idea how Delicious Foods made the list. And I'm still wondering why there is never any mention of A Reunion of Ghosts. Has anyone read this book? Thoughts?
I "enjoyed" A LITTLE LIFE, and I think it's themes are vitally important, but in the end I felt it was incredibly flawed. I felt somewhat similarly about THE TURNER HOUSE -- a very good and "important" story, but with some elements that just didn't work for me.
Among other contenders, I think I enjoyed FATES AND FURIES more than ALL, but in my opinion, it is also probably more flawed. Further, it did not deal with the same kind of culturally/socially "important" (I am using a broad brush here, forgive me) themes that I would love a Pulitzer winner to confront, especially when there are options that do to choose from. FORTUNE SMILES was a "good" (but only good) collection, but won't win Johnson his second Pulitzer. I did not read DELICIOUS FOODS.
Bonus Pick: THE SYMPATHIZER - I don't think many people are talking about this one. It doesn't exactly have American themes, as it is narrated by a Vietnamese spy, but he is living in the US for a large chunk of the book. Moreover, it is a book that brilliantly crosses genres.
The Pulitzer Prize has been extremely populist in the last few years, so I just feel A Little Life will take it in the end with A Manual for Cleaning Women and Eileen as finalists. Maybe even there could be a third finalist and A Little Life takes it as the vote of the committee, not the jury.
Black River (This was a favorite of mine for most of 2015 but it didn't seem to get that much recognition, great book though).
I know The Sellout is the leading contender, but I have not read it yet as I mostly just buy first printings and this is proving hard to get, however I have read Tuff by Beatty, and that was not for me.
Before I go I would like to thank all of you for another great year of Pulitzer discussions, it''s a pleasure to share your advice an expertise, thank you.
Anything else that seemed a big deal when it came out but which has since been overlooked or faded?
(I ask, because there is part of me that feels you could see an unexpected, but deserving, lineup this year. For example, I could see "The Mare", "A Hand Reached Down to Guide Me", and "A Manual for Cleaning Women" being the finalists. Thoughts?).
A Little LIfe is the best book that I read that pubbed in 2015, but I think its extreme dark subject matter will count against it. If it happened for this book, though, I would be thrilled.
I also thought that Black River was very impressive and tightly written, so that's my dark horse candidate for this year's prize.
The second one will be a short stories collection, probably one that flies under the radar right now (there's always some surprised in the Pulitzer finalists).
Having read none of the books on this list (or anything published in 2015 that would be eligible for the prize, for that matter), I am clearly qualified to weigh in with my uneducated guesses:.
@proseimprint That's kind! I think I've located a copy, may turn back to you if not!
@BRAKiasaurus Pretty much positive PREPARATION is not eligible. Every now and then the NYT best of lists include a book that is a year old, for some reason. I'd be happy with BRAGGSVILLE taking it.
I think it's Braggsville, A Little Life, and Tsar with Braggsville taking it...unless Preparation for the Next Life is inexplicably eligible this year (as it was on the New York Times notable list), in which case it should go to that.
@W_Shadbolt @ey814 @myram319 Totally agree with W_Shadbolt. The Tsar read more like a novel. I realize that it doesn't focus on American Life, but there is a tiny bit in the end that I'm hoping will push it forward for consideration. It was my favorite followed by A Little Life.
@ey814 @proseimprint Well it looks like your post has stirred up the hornets nest. I have an extra copy of Delicious Food if your interested.
@Guardiands I almost chose FATE over LITTLE LIFE for a finalist. Again, it's another book that could make a run at the prize.
I have enjoyed reading all the comments here but want to toss my vote to A Little Life. Also, I am very disappointed that A Reunion of Ghosts by Judith Claire Mitchell was overlooked. As we look to next year I would hope that something as simple as Dawn of Wonder or The Life We Bury, both written by Debut Novelists, will get serious attention. Respectfully...
@myram319 I haven't read nearly enough to make any really educated guesses, but I enjoyed Tsar a lot more than The Sellout and am rooting for it as well. I think we'll see A Little Life on there as well, but although Johnson is one of my favorite contemporaries, I don't see his follow up to Orphan Master being a finalist. If they want a short story collection, McCann is a good choice.
@proseimprint @ey814 I think Did You Ever Have a Family sort of faded from view since it came out early in the year, and agree it could be a finalist. Wishing I'd read Delicious Foods. Now scrambling to find a first edition of it, just in case!
@AlexKerner I agree that it is a book that will stand out for this year, for all the reasons you've articulated, after other books have faded from mind. It's why I included it as a finalist, but I wouldn't at all be surprised if it won.
Fortune Smiles is what I want to pick, but I honestly don't see it happening. Then I was thinking (and wanting) Tsar, but I think they will stress the American emphasis this year. I haven't finished The Sellout yet, but I think that it will be a finalist with Fates, with Did You Ever Have a Family winning it all.
so my pick is going to be A Little Life.
I would be happy to see The Sellout win. It was a brilliantly witty and timely book that can rightfully be considered a big "I" IMPORTANT book that we will be talking about for many years to come.
@AlexKerner @GeorgeKing1 @jfieds2 Okay, so let me try to objectively evaluate the utility of the TOB to predict the Pulitzer. I'll honestly try to be objective! (And, I would note, I think the TOB is a fun exercise and I follow it each year.).
Just finished Hulse's "Black River" and simply adored the book. So pretty, overall, and much like the Kent Haruf novels, such as "Plainsong" that I've enjoyed over the years. "Black River" is surely one of the best five I've read this year. Solid Pulitzer choice, in my opinion. Side note: As I've mentioned before, I surely don't understand all of the hoopla surrounding "The Sellout," with so many other worthy contenders. But, what do I know? I'm only a reader. :-) Read on ...
And, since people always ask, here are the next 10:.
@BRAKiasaurus Great news! I loved the book, and it's certainly deserving. So much better than the "top faves," I believe.
@GeorgeKing1 @jfieds2 @AlexKerner The Tournament of Books (sorry shouldn't have used the acronym). It's a competition that is run by The Morning News website annually. They choose the top 16 books (according to their committee I guess) and then pair them off in brackets (like the March Madness in basketball). Each pairing is judged by one person, who decides which book moves on.
@jfieds2 @AlexKerner maybe silly but any more silly than a jury of three or five doing the same? I think one of the motivations of starting the TOB was the absurdity of book competitions in general (which we all love) and taking it to its logical conclusion...battle to the death with zombies :).
So the Tournament of Books is down to its finals, with The Turner House going up against The Sellout. It has been a really intense year and the discussion boards for the A Little Life decisions were quite amazing in the scope of discussion. I realize that TOB isn't in the statistical model but it still has been quite predictive with the winner or finalist often winning the Pulitzer.
I spent an hour or two last week searching online databases (abe, bookfinder, thriftbooks, etc.) for used hardcover copies of The Sellout. Anytime I found one, I called the business and asked if they could pull the book from the shelf and read the number line to me. Finally, it paid off. Coas Books in New Mexico had a copy for $7.39. I ordered it and it just arrived. It's a near fine 1st printing!
@JohnZ @ey814 @jfieds2 JohnZ do you think that because the Pulitzer Prize web pages have been stressing that this is the 100th Pulitzers that the American theme might be very important for all the winners this year.
As for Hamilton, at this point wouldnt it be considered a just weird that it did not win.
The notes and telegrams are quite interesting, in that one may find lists of books and collections that were considered, as well as reasons for why some of them did not find a slot as regards the three finalists. Sometimes one may glean the cheerleading that was done for a particular book or collection (i.e., So Big; Tales from the South Pacific). There was also a year when James Alan McPherson made note of Robert Pirsig's Lila: An Inquiry into Morals. The winner that year, however, was Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres.
Given that the last couple of winners for Fiction were also bestsellers (meaning they were well on the radar of the reading public), I'm wondering if the jury and board will this year opt for a winner that stands beyond the limelight -- that is, until it's announced as a winner.
@MH631 Wow. I'm completely gobsmacked and envious! So cool. I would love to see some of those. The Reivers signed to his mistress and her daughter the day before he died has got to be pretty close to the ultimate version of that one! This confirms that we have to figure out some opportunity for collectors to get together somewhere or sometime and compare notes, swap extras, etc.! Thanks for posting this!
As for the Sotheby's auction, go up to the top of the page and check the mast on the left. There's a link for it... and you're right, the minimum was not met.
The American Academy of Arts and Letters announced their 2016 Literature Award Winners. This isn't one of the predictor variables (though I'll have to see if I can find information about past winners, might be able to include it if it goes back far enough), but some familiar names are on the list:.
@jfieds2 Not sure, but it can't be much earlier than that just due to the number of books needing to be read.
If I win the lottery we will all go. You get a 1st edition etc. Think Oprah you get a car, you get a car, to infinity and beyond.
Forgot to mention...While you're waiting for the 2016ers, you may enjoy the Pulitzer take on March Madness, Pulitzer Madness, a very quick survey: Choose your favorite Pulitzer-winning novel, in each of four regions: bit.ly/FictionMdnss.
@jfieds2 We cannot offer any specifics but can tell you the various juries meet at different times throughout the year. We aim to give the Board as much time as we can.
@ey814 We are so appreciative to have great fans like you. We will certainly share your requests with the Board but unfortunately cannot guarantee any outcome.
And please feel free to let us know what discussions arise. We like the feedback, and it's fun too.
@AlexKerner Thanks for the smart thinking! You will be please to know that's exactly what we're doing - waiting until after the complete announcement to post the list on the site.
You will be able to watch from the pulitzer.org site itself, or on our YouTube channel, or on Facebook, which will be a different feed. Your choice.
@PulitzerPrizes @pulitzerprize also can i recommend that you don't post the winners on your website until AFTER the live streaming. Last year people were already shouting out the winners before the presenter had made the announcement because the winners had been posted on the site right away. For suspense purposes it would be great if that doesn't happen this year.
@OneMoreBook My sense is that any of these you mention have a shot. Sellout got the bulk of the points, but I think this year is as wide open as I can recall. I'm just finishing Turner House, and like it a lot. I have Eileen and Tsar teed up to read next!
Good luck with this year's process, if the discussion thread is any indication, this will be a good year with a difficult decision to be made!
The 2016 Prizes will be announced April 18 at 3pm ET.
@OneMoreBook I could not agree more. I am hanging onto my first edition it case it wins, and if it doesn't it'll go straight into a Little Free Library.
I really don't understand all of the hoopla over THE SELLOUT. Just a so-so book, in my opinion. Minor work. I struggled through it, and can never get back the time spent on that tome. EILEEN and HONEYDEW are sooooooo much better, not to mention THE TURNER HOUSE, TSAR, DID YOU EVER, and others. I'm reading DELICIOUS FOODS right now, and think it's a major-serious contender as well. BLACK RIVER is next on my list, and I can't wait. But, what do I know? :-) Read on ...
@BRAKiasaurus It's usually early March, just doesn't really get much publicity, so you have to look for it!
@BRAKiasaurus @Marybethking @jfieds2 Thanks, jfieds2! Because of you I now have a first edition of the book. I just wanted to read it, but couldn't find it in my area. The closest library that had a copy was 3 1/2 hours away. So I purchased a used book at a goodwill store online, and was surprised to get what appears to be an unread (new) copy of the first printing.
@jfieds2 I had just started following this group a couple weeks before reading your post. I picked it up a couple of days later, thought it was the best book of the year until I read Tsar. If The Sympathizer wins The PEN/Faulkner that will make the Pulitzer a little more interesting.
I am not much for "tooting my own horn" buuuuuuut, you did hear it here first: http://fyre.it/PfcL8m. (July 12, 2015). If I'm right, I bet it's a once in a lifetime prediction, at least that far in advance.
I'll run the final analysis when the PEN/Faulkner announcement is made, but I suggest collectors seek out a 1st edition of The Sellout, as it will be firmly in 1st place.
At some point, however, the idea of reading the list in reverse came to me. The idea of traveling back in time, as it were, and gleaning social context and possible cultural aesthetics, were too fascinating to pass up.
But it's the surprises that really enervated me and kept me reading through to the end (or should it be, the beginning?). Well... the fact that I can be stubborn didn't hurt, either (ha ha).
That said, there's no book I wouldn't recommend in the list (albeit some with reservations). After all, the great thing about reading (or any other artistic medium, really) is that we have an opportunity to consider the world and ourselves from perspectives often dissimilar to our own. And that's not bad at all. In fact, it's how we grow as individuals.
@ey814 Also, thank you for posting the list! The website is set up strangely--the announcement almost gets buried--but I would have completely missed it. I feel like it often comes later in the year? But maybe I'm thinking of a different award...
@ey814 why is this year an outlier in terms of its impact on the list?
Right, i'm putting two lotteries on this weekend.
On the minus side, there was no jacket on His Family, and So Big had one of those ugly dust jackets from 1958. Years of Grace was an early printing in early dust jacket, but signed. South Pacifc had a later DJ, and there were a few other later jackets as well. I wrote about it here:.
Overall I thought it was a nice collection.
@JohnZ I thought about you when I posted the URL, knowing you had recently finished the entire run. I've ready every Pulitzer from Confederacy of Dunces (1980), and then about 1/3 of the books before 1980, but not reading in any order, just whatever strikes me. I intende to read them all, though Cheever's Collected Stories and Mailer's Executioner's Song will undoubtedly be last, given how long they are!
I try my best to find Pulitzers with DJs but it's nearly impossible to find the earlier ones with DJs without paying an arm and a leg. I would say over half of my 1st printings have DJs.
I've had some luck with finding a few 1st editions at Half Price Books. I picked up a copy of Advise & Consent for $15. I would highly recommend this place for new collectors. They have a rare books section too.
Did anyone know what happened to that Sotheby auction a few years back? Did the seller end up selling his collection at another auction? I vaguely remembered that the minimum was not met.
@MC74 @ChrisEllis77 @ey814 I also get excited each year on the run up to the announcement, but I am finding in recent years I have already read the winner, takes a little from it, don't you think.
As for Lamb in His Bosom you need a lot of luck and a pile of cash, I know its very rare.
Posts like these inspire me and are a driving force behind my recent goal in collecting and reading quality literature. Thank you.
Often, instead of reading the first book presented in the list (Ernest Poole's "His Family"), I worked backward -- a sensation that made me feel as if I were traveling back in time. Early in my reading, I did skip around, focusing on those books I already had sitting on my bookshelves. Eventually, though -- after pinching pennies and locating titles that were harder to find -- I had every Pulitzer-winner, which was when it occurred to me to begin my time-travel reverse reading.
@ey814 Nice article, reading them is the easy bit, it's finding them in first edition form, I too have read them all, however only own about half.
But my point is that maybe the American life theme is still a lot more important for the Pulitzer than we're thinking after ATLWCS and TOMS.
(As a side note, I don't think either Marra or Beatty will win the NBCC. Ferrante has a lot going for her, it will be tough to beat her this year.).
I meant to make that a smiley face, haha, not a frown!
@W_Shadbolt Been meaning to respond for a while, just traveling too much. With regard to the "Pulitzer in recognition of a body of work" situation, it shouldn't happen, but it clearly has. The jury letter for Eudora Welty's Optimist's Daughter specifically said that the book was among the best, but that Ms. Welty should have won the Pulitzer for a prior book, so they might as well give it to her now. I think that it could play a role next year with DeLillo, if Zero K is any good at all.
Since the update was kind of tucked into a comment on a thread, just a heads up to anyone interested: The 2017 forum was kindly opened (by, I believe, tklein27) and is already in motion. :(.
@BRAKiasaurus This was one of the monthly selections from Book Passage out your way for the signed first edition club, so I'm guessing she is local to you. The PEN/Faulkner isn't a very good predictor of the Pulitzer... this will help Delicious foods in the rankings and, to a lesser degree, The Sympathizer, otherwise not so much.
@ey814 Very interesting selection! I have most of those books at home--and I keep looking at "Mendocino Fire" in the store (I think she's relatively local, so a lot of signed copies floating around). Thanks for the heads up! I figured it was happening today, actually, and then totally forgot to check, hahaha.
@proseimprint @jfieds2 @tklein27 Yes, it already looks to be a strong year, and the 2017 page is now ready for action...
@BRAKiasaurus nevermind, it's called scrolling!! Couldn't find the novel when I googled him though.
First time poster, longtime reader of this blog.Thank you for providing such an interesting forum! I check in here religiously.
@BRAKiasaurus Yes, you are correct Mr Shearer is British and therefore not eligible. I would also be interested to know who would replace him.
My money is on The Tsar of Love and Techno.
So my "first edition" is probably a "fifth edition", which is a bit depressing. But still worth $20 and the short lived excitement of thinking I had a first edition.
So much to learn though. Love this place.
I think Alex Shearer is a british novelist. If so, does this bump him from the list? If he were to fall off the list (due to citizenship) who would supplant him?
350 for The Sellout is a farce.
@jfieds2 @tklein27 I enjoy the involvement of this post. This is going to be a strong year. Having read "What belongs To You," "Young Blood," "Ways to Disappear," all very good books but four others have so far stood out for me "The Vegetarian," "Free Men," "Tender" and "Poor Your Soul." I am ready now for the heavy hitters for me stating this month with "Gone With the Mind," "The Association of Small Bombs," and "Innocents and Others.".
Yes, good idea. I'll get a new page up very soon.
@tklein27 I'd say it's almost time to open a new message board! I forget if you have normally waited for one year to be total "over," (with an announcement of the price) but many 2017 contenders are coming out soon!
@AlexKerner @BRAKiasaurus I can't find it--I keep looking. She was just at book passage. I would recommend looking at the upcoming schedule for bookstores near you. I know she's going to greenlight books, book passage, etc.
Hanya Yanagihara is finally doing a book tour, by the way, for the paperback edition.
Just finished The Sellout. I liked it a lot but at times it seemed a little uneven. Some jokes also fell flat, and when Beatty kept going off the narrative tracks to simply make some of these jokes, it got annoying. Still, this wasn't too big a problem, I'd probably give it a 4/5.
Also, if anyone is looking for a break from the hunt; check out 'Perfect Days.' Raphael Montes I believe?
@proseimprint Oh, very nice. This is a report I read once in a google book (published by university press or another)...and while I completely disagree with their assessment of "Rabbit, Run", the title of which they didn't even record accurately, I think Lee probably did deserve the award.
Had it been another year, I probably would have given it to Updike.
Also worth noting: their dismissal of "A Separate Peace" due to its length. I'm glad to see other juries haven't considered this a point of contention (see: Train Dreams, Tinkers, etc.).
It's possible that the publisher felt it too regional to do well in sales but wanted to give his voice a chance. Only 100 pages in, but if you liked the above authors, I definitely recommend it.
(In all honesty, as well-written as it is, it is also a relief to read after much of my recent lineup: "Preparation for the Next Life", "We Are Not Ourselves", "Between the World and Me", "A Little Life", "The Sellout"...with the exception of a couple reads, like "Undermajordomo Minor", it has been a heavy year.).
Thank you to the Pulitzer for sharing this wonderful article http://www.pulitzer.org/article/14174.
@ChrisEllis77 - Same here. I've been looking for a 1st printing for the past few weeks and no luck. A copy sold on eBay for $350 last week.
On a separate note, I am trying to complete my Pulitzer collection. If anyone on the board knows where I could get a 1st copy of Lamb in His Bosom (at a reasonable price, not the $7500 copy of Abebooks), I would be forever indebted to you. I enjoy reading everyone's post. Keep up the good work.
@jfieds2 Enjoying this book, but it isn't necessarily an award winner. Reminds me a little of the pleasure I received, though, from reading "The Imperfectionists" (which, actually, was a much more perfect book). Strong writing.
@ChrisEllis77 I might be down. Need to finish reading it first, though.
@Marybethking I totally agree with you regarding A Little Life. 110%.
Hello all, I am just wondering if anyone has a 1st printing of The Sellout they wish to sell. I understand this is a long shot but if there is anyone out there let me know. Thanks.
Another book I'm looking forward to: https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/amy-gustine/you-should-pity-us-instead/.
@BRAKiasaurus It's also a paperback original right? That would be an interesting winner!
Okay, just sent the next list to Tom to post. Here it is:.
Nothing new is announced (predictor variable-wise) until March, so this is it for the rest of the month.
@OneMoreBook I'll have to part ways with you on Braggsville and Sellout, but I'm on board with Turner House. I'm 1/4 way through it, and like it a lot. I agree that Johnson is unlikely to win another Pulitzer so soon, or for a short story collection.
Things changed over the years, The line of beauty is not less explicit than The folding star, but 10 years later that wasn't a problem to win the Booker.
Anyway, what belongs to you has more things against it, it's located in Bulgaria, and being released in january makes more difficult to reach awards season with the hype intact.
@worldbfreeheel I believe last year's finalists were announced March 10th (which was later, if I recall correctly, than previous years). I'm not sure why they hold it so close to the vest.
@jfieds2 @TELyles @BRAKiasaurus @ey814 I have it on my shelf--possibly on your recommendation jfieds--not sure! But I still look forward to reading it. I like to support debut novelists. Kind of fun to find new people to get excited about...and on occasion, it puts you ahead of the crowd sometimes (which is why I have a first edition of "Preparation for the Next Life").
@jjose712 @AlexKerner We have had some controversy on this thread earlier about gay themes, etc. We have not touched on the graphic sexual aspect of novels, however. My guess is that that is not a factor in whether awards are won or lost, honestly. Just as Updike won twice for his often-explicit "Rabbit" novels, it comes down to the writing itself and how it contributes to the narrative of the characters.
Anyway, after reading a quick sample of the writing--and given the price--I bought it on Amazon. It sounds promising, so I'll keep everyone posted.
@AlexKerner @jfieds2 I was almost going to delete my comment! I am feeling grouchy today. It does look like the kind of book that could be a finalist for multiple awards...
While I get you may not want to spend 500pp on a book, the buzz around this has been pretty off the charts so I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss.
so totally skipping ahead to 2017...Alexander Chee's The Queen of the Night has gotten tons of buzz and comes out today and is an early favourite for next year's award.
@TELyles @OneMoreBook Completely disagree about "Braggsville". Of the books I've read this year, it remains my favorite and the most deserving. But I do find "The Sellout" both brilliant and challenging...it jumps into its fast-paced, allusion-laced, comedic monologue in a way that, frankly, took some acclimating. But once you muscle through the prologue, it smooths out.
@OneMoreBook Have you read the Marra? I am halfway through the stories and if they had any link to "American life" then that would be my pick, without any reservation.
I barely made it through WELCOME TO BRAGGSVILLE. Ugh. Frankly, it wore me out, reading the tome. I gave up completely on THE SELLOUT, even before the end of the 29-page prologue. Both were way too cumbersome. My favorite so far, for the Pulitzer? THE TURNER HOUSE. The Clegg and Johnson books were just "OK" for me, but I can't believe we'll have a repeat winner with Johnson this year. Still waiting for a book to "wow" me.
@W_Shadbolt @ey814 if I recall, this tends to be a good indicator (much like the NBCC), but it isn't a deal maker or breaker.
@ey814 Interesting to see "Black River" and "Delicious Foods" show up again. I feel like those two were mentioned a lot early in 2015 and haven't been discussed much since.
I think Alvar is in fact a citizen.
Otherwise, this list is pretty much expected. No real surprises this year. :).
Will this be the final list, or is there one more after?
I'll run the numbers for the next list late next week, but clearly The Sellout is likely to be at the top of the list, followed by Fates and Furies, then Little Life, then Fortune Smiles (again, I'm just eye-balling this). Somewhat surprised that Purity isn't on the ALA list. Same with Braggsville.
If Sellout wins the NBCC, that may seal the deal for it. If not, it's a closer race.
@Guardiands Here's some details about the first edition.
Will be surprised if "A Little Life" isn't among the finalists.
@Guardiands I have one--if anyone wants me to keep an eye out, happy to do so.
I'm about 60 pages into "The Sellout" and I understand the acclaim. So far, I enjoyed "Braggsville" more, but I'll keep you posted.
My guess about the finalists at this point is:.
I think I'd rather see a relevant novel win the award. So far, my favorite has been "Braggsville", which I read as soon as it was published last February. It remains the strongest book I've read.
The Story Prize, now in its 12th year, is pleased to honor as its finalists three outstanding short story collections chosen from 100 submissions representing 64 different publishers or imprints. They are:.
And the spotlight award has also been given, this year to a graphic novelist:.
Now I wonder if my 1st edition i bought on eBay is legit....
As for the Marra, it didn't happen last year, but the two years before that this board was going crazy over Anne Frank and The Son, both of which wound up being finalists. I've seen a bit of buzz about him on here, I wonder if he'll be nominated.
I think you two bring up good points about the characters, the nature of their friendships and their, eventual, success in the fields of their choosing. Unrealistic? Yes, but I'm willing to go where the author takes me. For instance, I doubt that Jude would lack formal education and suffer years of abuse, only to be accepted into a good college, matriculate into an Ivy law school, obtain an advanced math degree at the same time, while simultaneously working at a bakery where he becomes an excellent baker, on top of being an exemplary cook. But this is where we are taken, so I will go along with the ride.
My main issue with A Little Life is more technical. Harold's letters to Willem drew me out of the story whenever they would pop up. I felt they disrupted from the flow of the overall story and I struggled to understand their place in the narrative.
End of the day, I'm glad I read the novel but it is not one I could universally recommend.
@BRAKiasaurus I think it would be hard to give it the Pulitzer... it's so unrelenting. I can't think of any prior winner even remotely like it. But, I'm not betting against it!
@ey814 Would you give it the pulitzer? I think it may well be a finalist, so I'm curious whether the jury would ultimately choose it.
As to the extreme success and wealth of all characters, I noticed that as well. It did strike me as an intentional choice, though. Any thoughts on why she made the choice?
@BRAKiasaurus Yeah, I agree. The only book I really questioned being on the list at all was Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, which I liked, but wouldn't put in the 12 greatest books of the 21st Century!
@ey814 The order of this is wild, to me. Every single novel is definitely very good, but I'm shocked that the number 1 is Diaz's novel. Interesting choices, though. Would like to read "Half of a Yellow Sun".
@AlexKerner Some interesting novels on here, including some I haven't yet read or heard much about. I somehow doubt we'll see many surprises this year (although I do feel like the pulitzers have been really strange the past few years...with the missing award, the three finalists / fourth winner, and the goldfinch--a decent but problematic novel--chosen against a particularly strong year of novels), but I bet most of these novels are pretty solid.
Worth noting: "Oreo" is in contention, but if I"m not mistaken, that novel came out originally in the 70s. Not sure if it qualifies for the pulitzer as a result (which is almost odd, given that a short story collection that contains even one new story or new title will qualify)...any thoughts? I hear it is a very good novel.
An interesting list of the 12 "greatest novels of the 21st Century" (so, since 2000) compiled by BBC Culture contributor Jane Ciabattari. The methodology probably accounts for the domination of US authors (polled several dozen book critics, most of whom looked to be from US outlets--not sure why more British critics weren't included. But, among the 12 listed, six won the Pulitzer and one was a Pulitzer finalist. Another Pulitzer winner was a runner-up. We sometimes talk about whether the Pulitzer recognizes the very best novels, but according to these critics, it seems to do a pretty good job!
Sorry about the outage. Should be okay now.
By the way, this happened: http://pen.org/2016-pen-literary-awards-longlists.
@BRAKiasaurus Am i the only one who don't love the flamethrowers? Don't get me wrong, i think it's a good novel and i love Kushner's writing but i loved Telex from Cuba so much that The Flamethrowers was a bit dissapointing.
I can't have an opinion of this year's candidates. Fates and furies will be published here in Spain this year, but it won't be published till at least April.
@ey814 @BRAKiasaurus It wasn't me--but thank you. :).
@ey814 @BRAKiasaurus Agree, although I am curious if the fact of the election (apparently publishers often withhold some books until after the election, since that dominates coverage and, for that matter, accounts for many of readers' purchases) will make 2017 a big year of wonderful fiction. We saw this play out in 2013. But I agree. This may mean that the books that get the most attention are by authors which already have a readership, a following. Premature to say such things, but the aforementioned authors are ripe for pulitzers.
@ey814 @BRAKiasaurus Agree about Gates. Bought it as soon as it came out but haven't had a chance to dive into it yet. Wood's endorsement is reason enough for me. I just need to finish up "Refund" and some other collections I'm in the middle of. This received endlessly strong reviews when it came out, and I think it bears watching.
Not a good indicator for Pulitzers (he did not like The Goldfinch, for example, felt The Flamethrowers to be masterful--and, let's be honest, The Flamethrowers probably should have been a finalist that year), but he is a wonderful and astute critic who I agree with more often than not:.
Didn't realize it until this list, but Annie Proulx has a new novel out--and it's a big one! "Barkskins: A Novel".
@Guardiands See some of my thoughts regarding "A Little Life" in the comment section above :).
They also bring up why it is called "A Little Life", reminding me who first says the phrase, and then why the phrase--applied more broadly to the themes of the novel--was used as the title. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but it made me really appreciate the novel in some ways. It is a very thoughtful choice--we can discuss more when you're finished.
I must say that, while I won't recommend this novel to anyone, I think it was powerful. It felt to me like performance art, something I endured, an artistic experience which divides people but is undeniably compelling.
@BRAKiasaurus @ey814 I'm 500 pages into it. Brutal. One thing that I'm not really buying is that the people in Jude's life remain as loyal to him as all of them are... I don't care how kind and generous you are, supporting someone with as many issues as does Jude takes a toll after 15-30 years. The friendships don't feel very reciprocal, which make it hard to maintain a friendship.
@Marybethking I haven't heard anything about her having a new book out...this surprises me, honestly, given how crazy the world went for "Gone Girl" (a novel I admittedly didn't think much of). Are you referring to The Grownup? I think that may in fact be a re-issue of an older work.
@ey814 @BRAKiasaurus So (as I have this week off) I'm now almost 600 pages through, and it only gets worse... -_- This is a rough book to binge read. My next novel will need to be something a bit lighter...at the very least, short stories.
@BRAKiasaurus I'm at about the same place in the book... devastating is the right descriptor.
Essentially, winning the Pulitzer more than once is very rare, so once you've won it, having done so counts against you for future wins, and, apparently, not many people who are one-time finalists actually go on to win for another book. Even though McDermott, DeLillo, and Oates are multiple-finalists, that is a pretty insignificant variable in the long run, mainly because so few people have been finalists more than once since 1982 (when my database begins).
By the way, thanks for the first list!
Also, 250 pages into "A Little Life"--hard to read and yet hard to put down. Really devastating after about 65 pages in...
Lucia Berlin may also turn out to be a strong contender. Been awhile since we've seen a posthumous award.
Okay, here we go. This is the first prediction list for the 2016 Pulitzer Prize. Bear in mind the following:.
1. It's early. Most of the annual awards that are good predictor variables have not been given out nor finalists announced.
2. This list essentially uses data from the NYTimes best of lists, the National Book Award finalists/winner, and from the author's previous history with regard to awards (e.g., prior winner of an award, prior finalist, etc.).
3. There are 75 books entered for consideration right now, drawn from discussions on this site, best of lists, and award announcements to date. There will be more added as they emerge in other award lists, I'm sure.
Some observations on why these books ended up in the top 15.
2. Fortune Smiles presence near the top should be self-evident.
3. Perhaps the most interesting entry here is A Manual for Cleaning Women by Lucia Berlin. This is a posthumously published collection of short stories that was on the NY Times 100 best and made their top 10 list.
12. Morrison has a slew of past awards and nominations, so pretty much anything she publishes will put her on the list until more awards come out for current year books.
Other books that have gotten some attention on this list and where they are now:.
Very cool that you live there! I'll reach out to them, but I suppose I can also just be patient, haha. If you are ever in the states, I would also be happy to send you some books but totally get the cist of overseas shipping...it can get pricy!
I just finished Gillian Flynn's new book and thought it was really good.
@BRAKiasaurus Hi, I would in normal circumstances be happy to past it on or swap it, but I live in Norway in Scandinavia, so I guess the postage is a big cost, however I know Powells in Portland have had a few, maybe if you contact them you could arrange a swap or through my experience with them, they may just give you one. Hope it's some help.
I may be one of the few here who has not yet read any of the Erdrich novels. Need to get on that--I own them both.
I have to say: it is always wonderful to find that a new favorite author is also fairly prolific! This seems true of Geronimo Johnson (who said at a reading that he wrote two novels after "hold it till it hurts"--of which "braggsville" was one (so expect another from him relatively soon, I guess). Marra is another! This is great news!
Chriselliot, would you be willing to pass on that ARC to me? I would be happy to swap as I have a number of ARCs from 2015. Just let me know! (Same goes for anyone else. I'd love to get some swaps happening here.).
@ey814 I didn't know 'The Round House' was a series. I'm going to have to check this out.
@BRAKiasaurus Can't believe I forgot this one:.
Third in the trilogy by Louise Erdrich. The first one (Plague Doves) was a Pulitzer finalist, second one (Round House) won the National Book Award (and, in my opinion, should have won the Pulitzer). If this is as good as those two were and as it sounds, I have high expectations for it.
@BRAKiasaurus I have an ARC of Tuesday Nights in 1980 by Molly Prentiss, it's very well written and a great read, I can easily see this being a contender, very popular at the very least.
@BRAKiasaurus Looks like this is drawn just from best of lists, which are, of course, helpful, but not all that reliable as a predictor on their own. Agree though that the top books will likely be at the top of our list as well. I plan to do the first list next week, so we'll see.
@myram319 @BRAKiasaurus I saw Russo last year, and asked him what he was working on and he mentioned the sequel to Nobody's Fool, so I'm very much looking forward to this... as well as the Marra.
Not to get ahead of the group here--I'm only just now 200 pages into "A Little Life", a book I've found hard to put down so far, so I clearly have plenty to read from 2015--but I have a few 2016 books that I'm getting excited about:.
Anyone else looking forward to next year's releasees? I'm particularly excited about Jansma and Prentiss. Bock and Delillo could be good, although I never know what type of book the latter will release. Haslett sounds like he has written something beautiful (along the lines of the short stories in his debut collection), so I will be keeping my eye on that one. (I may have to be pretty selective about my reading in 2016 / 17. New baby on the way! I imagine that will take away some of my reading time, hahaha).
Anyway, anyone else have books they're looking forward to?
Will we have a prediction list in the coming weeks?
Vaguely reminds me of what we got goin' on on this site...albeit more data goes into the stuff here. That said, it would surprise me if we don't see both of the books atop that list as finalists for this year's pulitzer.
This is interesting (scroll down for books): http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/judging-by-best-of-lists-kendrick-lamar-was-2015s-cultural-icon/.
@wadamreed @JohnZ @W_Shadbolt Your question is a tough one to answer. I enjoyed many of the Pulitzer winners, with a few here and there which didn't particularly appeal to me. Also, one has to consider that what he or she looks for in a novel or collection may not be that for which others look. Aesthetics and art, you know.
Bearing that in mind, here is a list of those winners which have stayed in my memory. The first two are my favorites of all the winners; those following are listed in no particular order.
I know -- it's more than ten. But these are the ones that gave me hours of both enjoyment and contemplation.
100 pages into "A Little Life" and enjoying it a lot. Might just be a nice break from the measured, largely internal Clegg novel. I haven't gotten to the overwhelmingly depressing things I keep hearing about, so I'll keep you posted.
As for Vollman, who knows? Certainly he's a dynamic writer. I thought Europe Central might have had a chance -- if not as the work chosen for the prize during its year, then perhaps as a finalist.
Just this year, the board asked the jurors to provide a fourth title for consideration. As it was, the jury nominated Lovely, Dark, Deep; Let Me Be Frank With You; and The Moor's Account. One guesses the fourth title added -- All the Light We Cannot See -- was the eventual winner. (Maybe the board didn't want another ruckus, given to the wrath it incurred in 2011.).
As of late (i.e., the past two years), the board appears to be opting for more general fair. To be clear, neither of the last two novels to have won are bad novels (not to me, at least); however, they were nothing near obscure. Which is something that has happened in the past as regards the Pulitzer. Gone with the Wind won, after all.
Having read all of the Pulitzer winners in Fiction, I'd agree that the jury and board have mostly made choices that aren't embarrassing for them. Most of the novels and collections are good. Some are even great.
Agree with you about Welcome to Braggsville. I think it may well be a finalist, if not the winner.
I'm half-way through A Little Life. Talk about your bleakness piled on bleakness! I dunno, it seems a bit much so far, but it is a rich rendering of human thought and perception, if not a big overwrought on that. I'm interested in seeing where the last half leads!
At this point, Welcome to Braggsville may be my favorite novel of the year.
I enjoyed it, I didn't find the stove aspect too unbelievable. But given your view of that book, I look forward to your thoughts on A Little Life. That book I objectively was thinking "nope, not buying it" the whole time.
I don't think it deserves the pulitzer, but I would read his future endeavors. I think Clegg has it in him to write a great novel, but I'm not sure this one is as flawless as I would want from the pulitzer winner.
That said, I wonder what others think of this:.
I did not read his review until after I finished the novel.
I have a few short story collections to finish and then will start "A Little Life", I think.
this is an interesting piece about the backlash some of the bigger books have faced this year.
As we here will recall, she was on the jury during a particularly controversial year.
@AlexKerner @ey814 @BRAKiasaurus I think Prep still stacks up as one of the strongest books of this year or the last. Be amazing to see it win, but yes, the Nov. 2014 first run of the book had me confused. :).
Unlike past years, the list spotlights a few books that haven't gotten much attention, at all. I think that is great, but overall the list is not helpful to us, especially since 2 of 5 are translations. (One of those two certainly DID receive a lot of attention, though.).
The final two on the list are both ones that we have talked about: MANUALS FOR CLEANING WOMEN and THE SELLOUT. For me, THE SELLOUT is still my personal front runner, even as I have wanted to love other books more. Satire is not my thing, so I had high hopes to find a strong contender with a different kind of story in FATES AND FURIES and CITY ON FIRE (which I have tabled temporarily), but I'm not convinced either one will win.
@AlexKerner I'll make a note of this. Based on what I've read, the book doesn't much interest me, but it certainly is getting attention, on more than just the NYT list. I think it was on Buzzfeed (FWIW) and a few other lists so far.
so I just finished reading Delicious Foods and I think it deserves another little bump. It is a shame it hasn't made any award short lists yet but was on the NYTs 100 notable. It is really powerful and the writing is intense and particularly creative (one of the voices being that of crack cocaine).
@ey814 @kas1985 yeah I was a little disappointed but not surprised. Thought that maybe since B&N was an early supporter of the book, they might have some kicking around. David Mitchell signed firsts are probably worth grabbing, but I didn't buy any others.
I wonder how the B&N Goldfinch will fare on the market, and how many will try to pass it off.
@tklein27 @DustySpines @ey814 wow, I had not seen a signed one, but yes too rich for my blood. You could probably make a better investment with the $1500.
when is the first list coming out?
As you can see, it missed some pretty big books! Now, here are the books that won the Pulitzer (from 1982 onward) that were not on the NBCC finalist list:.
This list still missed a couple of big ones (how could The Color Purple not show up on either list, one wonders), but still has a substantially better track record than does the NYT 10 Best.
I'm also shocked that "braggsville" and clegg's novel aren't on the list. I'm reading the latter now, and it's quite good.
Also of note: "Preparation for the Next Life" is on the list...does this mean it is eligible for the Pulitzer this year!?
Limited to 500 copies and sells for $1,500.
@ey814 Thanks so much for the information. My copy has never been read and I would say that it is in Near Fine condition. I think I got it after I read someone else's hardcover, because the cost was less. I did the same with The Goldfinch. This was before I found out about Odyssey Bookstore's First Edition Club early this year. I'm extremely happy with their picks.
@ey814 @kas1985 I'm new to this, but was wondering if an Advanced Reader's Copy of ALL THE LIGHT is worth hanging on to. I didn't buy the actual hardcover of it.
@BRAKiasaurus Late to the game with this post, but I was rooting for Ta-Nehisi Coates' BETWEEN THE WORLD AND ME, which, of course, did win. I think it's an important book (I think we had a discussion about this earlier in the thread, just don't remember!).
Thanks!! I am also putting ALA for the win. People in the trees was brilliant too, not sure why it didn't receive as much attention?
@BRAKiasaurus Thanks for the recommendations! I own American Pastoral so I'll start there.
Has there been a discussion of this year's Barnes and Noble signed first editions? All the light we Cannot See is among them if I remember correctly. I wonder what these versions do to the market value. Also, it means B&N has a warehouse of first printings of Pulitzer prize winners they can throw on the market at any time. @ey814 take notice... I remember you saying you thought the B&N Goldfish was printed on inferior paper--I didn't notice that myself.
@BRAKiasaurus @AlexKerner @ey814 Compassionate is a great word. He is a funny guy and seems like a very nice man. The collection was terrific in my opinion. Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy, though Groff was really really personable when I chatted with her at the Brooklyn book festival this year so I was pulling for her. Had signed ARC and hardback of Refund so the collector in me was pulling for that.
@ey814 Oh! I thought maybe that was what you were aiming for but I threw that out there anyway.
Washington Post has its list of 10 best of 2015 out. "Braggsville" (my pick for this year's pulitzer winner) is on the list as is "A Little Life". A book we haven't paid much attention "The Book of Aron" is also on the list.
I'm not sure how I missed that Adam Johnson had a new book out. He is one of my favorites. I wonder if his new book will take the pulitzer this year as well.
@AlexKerner @ey814 I really like hearing him talk. Looks like a football player, but has a soft compassionate voice and good sense of humor. Spoken with him a number of times (he's local to the Bay area), and he's awesome--haven't read his collection, but definitely happy for his good fortune (no pun intended).
Adam Johnson has had a pretty good couple of years. I'll have to see if I can figure out when the last time an author's back-to-back books won NBA or Pulitzer. But, I heard Adam Johnson read Nirvana from Fortune Smiles, and it was very good (and he was a very nice guy.).
I think that's great. I loved Fortune Smiles! I really, really, thought A Little Life was well written, but so over the top, so lacking in believability. I felt like it was a chore to get through it.
Fortune Smiles might be the best book I've read this year.
@jfieds2 so Fortune Smiles won. It was good but I have to say that I was not overwhelmed by it and thought it wasn't as good as Mara's collection. Kudos to Johnson though.
NBA prediction: A LITTLE LIFE takes it. It wouldn't be my choice -- I'd go with FORTUNE SMILES (I've read all but REFUND) -- but Yanagihara win. Although far from perfect, the book deals with some important "American" themes in important ways. Lately the NBA seems to pick a book that does that kind of thing more so than the Pulitzer.
Based on the past, winning the NBA also makes winning the Pulitzer less likely. I was pulling for FATES AND FURIES to become my front runner in the Pulitzer hunt, but after finishing it last night, although I enjoyed it, I don't think it's the one.
I do not know who runs the site or their formula, but if you look at the past "best of year" lists, then the site's owner has done a terrific job of identifying stand out fiction from that calendar year. I expect that the list will fluctuate as award season progresses and best of lists are published, but at the current time Sympathizer is right up there with several other books which have been more widely discussed on this site.
Has anyone read 'Gold, Fame, Citrus?' I just can't get into it despite good reviews.
@Marybethking Glad to hear from someone who read it! I haven't read it yet, but picked it up based purely on the fact that Clegg recommended (and is the agent for) it.
Has anyone read Stacy Schiff's latest? She is someone I always read, but I haven't gotten to that one yet.
@AlexKerner @kriscoffield I snagged "The Shore" from the library when you first brought it up, Alex--I didn't have time to read it, however, so it was returned. Thank you for reminding me! I was meaning to give it a second shot. :).
@kriscoffield @ChrisEllis77 Agree with you about 10:04, by the way. My list, as I recall was: Preparation for the Next Life, 10:04, and Fourth of July Creek--and honestly, I still think that is a much much much stronger list than the one initially submitted.
@kriscoffield my finalist would be A Little Life and Fates and Furies. I know people had issues with the former, but I found it heartbreaking and majestic in its emotional scope. There is a reason it is piling on the awards and shortlists and I imagine that the Pulitzer will have difficulty not acknowledging it, at least as part of the three finalists.
In terms of the third choice. I would like to say The Shore, again a really interesting novel that is as much about place as it is about characters and plot. It hasn't gotten as much attention as other books this season, but the Pulitzer always seems to chose one dark horse, so lets go with this one.
"A Little Life" and "The Sympathizer", but I don't know what other title. Maybe "Tsar" or "The Sellout".
Just for fun, what would be your finalists today, if you had to name them? We're a little more than halfway through the year. There is still good literature to come. Just trying to gauge to board, so to speak.
@Marybethking @ChrisEllis77 Not likely to be a pulitzer contender (nor should it be) but definitely worth more than 20 pages!! Maybe you'll pick it up at a later date. :) Worth a second try, I think.
@ChrisEllis77 You're a better man than I am. I made it to page 20 of 'City of FIre' and was annoyed by how heavy it was to return to the library.
@ChrisEllis77 I'd push back on the idea that the Pulitzer is purely a popularity contest. Paul Harding's TINKERS (2010), for example, had such a small print run that few readers knew about it. The year's most popular books, by sales alone, are almost invariably (and by definition) popular fiction. Trade fiction.
I find several post-2000 (last 15 years) winners deserving of the award. For me, there's never "one book to rule them all." Rather, each year produces multiple works that pique my aesthetic, intellectual, and emotional interest. Some do so more than others; those are the books I find most worthy, particularly when they speak to an American theme (whatever that means in today's world).
So, to answer your question, I think the Pulitzer speaks to our communal need to narrate our times, values, humanity and lack thereof, and strengths and weaknesses as a society. Its relevance is in its ability to highlight how our individual stories pull society forward, or at least in new directions. I participate in this thread because it compels me to read the year's great writing. I'm also an aspiring author. Somewhat more aspirational than productive these days, but still.
So it leaves me to think, are we putting too much emphasises and time into the Pulitzer? Is it THAT special? Or is The Man Booker a better indicator of the years best novel? I think its more fair, includes the world not just the US, not forced into choosing the best campaign.
I have only read 200 pages of a loaned copy (my copy will be arriving in the form of Powells indiespensable) and I have to say I can see myself not getting to the end.
So what I am saying is, are we, being again led to the winner? The timing of the release of City of Fire, and campaign, smells really bad of a Pulitzer "wannabe".
@grahammyers @jfieds2 (Postscript: I'm so so so happy to have others with whom I can finally discuss this book. I procured an ARC and then had no one to talk to about the merits and downsides of the novel!).
@grahammyers @BRAKiasaurus @jfieds2 I actually think that opening couple of pages was my favorite bit of writing. It's a well-written novel; in fact, I may at some point even read it a second time now that I have slightly adjusted expectations (really didn't know what I was jumping into, honestly, and was hoping for something more literary, something closer to Delillo's work perhaps)...but I do wish that the novel had carried on like that introductory chapter.
2. "power transformers tilted up like weary crucifixes, shot through with rust and ice on the far side of a window he could see through only imperfectly, as he could remember the night only imperfectly.".
this happens throughout the book so far. he could have cut the adjectives down and had a stronger novel.
@BRAKiasaurus I finished FATES AND FURIES a week and a half ago... my initial opinion was that it was well written, but I didn't think it had the heft, if you will, for the Pulitzer. In reflection, I'm beginning to change my mind and could see it as a strong contender. I haven't read LITTLE LIFE or FAMILY yet, so will see how I feel after I finish those.
From what I can tell, the award has only been around since 2012, so too recent for me to add as a predictor variable. I would note that the winners for the last two years were ALL THE LIGHT and GOLDFINCH, so they've hit on the last two. On the other hand, the first three medal winners were not even Pulitzer finalists.
Has anyone read "Against the Country"?
Man, oh, man, do I ever agree with you about short novels about big things! But I did love "Middlesex" and "Underworld" as well. "Tinkers", "Train Dreams", and others like it seem to have been replaced by the big novel. Just as Jhumpa Lahriri's win in 2000 saw a resurgence in the short story, I think two years ago, when all three finalists were HUGE novels, may have sparked a rebirth of the large novel. "The Luminaries", "We Are Not Ourselves", "The Dying Grass" (admittedly Vollmann has always written huge novels), "A Little Life", "The Goldfinch", "The Son", "The Woman Who Lost Her Soul", "A Brief History of Seven Killings", "City on Fire" are all fat tomes and each has received its share of accolades, hefty advances, prizes, etc.
From this year--without having read all the possible nominees--I would probably still hand it to "Welcome to Braggsville". But it seems like Groff, Yanagihara, and Clegg have written some very resonant novels that I intend to read in the coming months. (Doing everything I can to resist re-reading "Preparation for the Next Life" again.).
It's uneven. You may well enjoy it--and you are welcome to! I was hoping for a literary epic, and it has its moments, but it is also a mystery novel that never entirely pays off on that trope and genre. I honestly want to hear from someone who unabashedly loves the novel!
@BRAKiasaurus just started it also. hope it's better than what i've hearing, although it did get a good review in the NYT.
Did you finish it already? So much promise in that novel...definitely a letdown.
@BRAKiasaurus I think the first three you listed are from this blog the biggest contestants so I would go with any of them.
so let down by 'City on Fire.' a two million dollar advance, are you serious?!
"A Little Life" is one of the three finalists for the Carnegie Medal. It's appearing in almost every awards shortlist, it seems. It's competing against the novel I mentioned, "The Sympathizer". Call me crazy, but they're both in my slowly-shortening Pulitzer shortlist.
Despite its supposed shortcomings, something tells me "City of Fire" may end up being a finalist or something. There's a lot of good reviews behind it, and I hear the writing, though excessive, is very exceptional, and does a great job in evoking the time period. Maybe they'll overlook its flaws and consider its ambition. It kind of reminds me of "Underworld".
What does everyone think about The Sympathizer?
@JohnZ Yes, I sometimes do rewrite people's sentences. Not often pulitzer winners, but when I was 13, I read a Dean Koontz novel and rewrote it in my head the whole way. Then again, he's an awful writer....
@ey814 BtWaM is difficult, tiny, and so so important. Glad you read that wonderful book! I hope it wins a pulitzer, frankly, but I'm not entirely certain what category would have it. It could sneak into general nonfiction, but (like "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius" before it) it would be something of an outlier.
In any case, yes "Fates and Furies" would also be worth reading. And I might be able to do double duty on that one, as I got the audiobook from the library in addition to owning a signed copy.
By the way, did Yanagihara do a book tour? The "events" page on her publisher's page was never up-to-date, and I swear she seems to have forgone any sort of formal signings....but maybe I'm mistaken? Anyone else notice this?
As good as it is, there are some dangling modifiers that have me shaking my head. For instance:.
"Antoinette was lying in the sun on the balcony in a black bikini and slash of red lipstick when Gaiwan came up the stairs carrying the family rocking chair.".
Some punctuation would have cleared things up, don't you think?
"On the balcony, and clad in a black bikini and slash of red lipstick, Antoinette was lying in the sun when Gaiwan came up the stairs, carrying the family rocking chair.".
"Wearing a black bikini and slash of red lipstick, Antionette was on the balcony and lying in the sun when Gawain, carrying the family rocking chair, came up the stairs.".
Still, thus far with F & F, the pros are outweighing the cons. I wish I could say the same for A LITTLE LIFE. As it is, I'm still not impressed. Not only that, but Yanagihara loves her split infinitives. I say this not from a place of snobbishness, but from one of perplexity. Clearly, she's an able writer (if a bit detached and clinical), so one wonders why she wouldn't take more time to sculpt her sentences properly.
That said, I will continue to sing the praises of DID YOU EVER HAVE A FAMILY. (Funny side note: Ms. Groff's agent is none other than Bill Clegg.).
@BRAKiasaurus I'm envious of your reading consumption and speed! If UNDER MAJORDOMO MINOR is a bit of a lark, might set you up for something more serious... LITTLE LIFE seems to fit that bill, though if you read FATES AND FURIES now, you'll have it read before the NBA is anounced.
I read Between the World and Me ad couldn't agree more that it is an important (and soboring) book. I hope it wins the NBA for non-fiction.
I really love this place, thanks for all the suggestions.
Okay, so I have a question for everyone here, but I'd like to briefly preface it with a word about my current read.
Here's where I'm at: I'm about 20 pages away from the end of "Under Majordomo Minor", which isn't likely to win any awards but is simply great fun.
I have to say, this has been a fantastic year for books, a significant improvement from last year.
@grahammyers I agree re: ALL THE LIGHT, but still think that Robinson's LILA is the book that will still be read in 30 years and should have won. I did like Lish's book, though.
@JohnZ FAMILY is up next, almost done with FATES & FURIES. The latter is well written, but I agree with an earlier comment that it doesn't seem very Pulitzer-ish. I'm also wanting to read Johnson's WELCOME TO BRAGGSVILLE.
@BRAKiasaurus @Marybethking I'm on 'Fates and Furies' right now. It's pretty good, but not knocking it out of the park for me yet. 'The Incarnations' was incredible.
@Marybethking I can't wait to read "The Incarnations"! I don't' believe it is eligible for the pulitzer, but it looks incredible. :) Based almost exclusively on the reviews, reception, and the current trends--and honestly, having read none of these yet...it looks like "Fates and Furies", "Have You Ever Had a Family" and "A Little Life" are the most likely contenders, in so far as novels are concerned.
A lot of great short story collections this year, so I could see one of them being included in the roundup. But I expect to see at least one of those three books being a finalist.
I also disliked A Little Life. I'm not sure I can voice why without risking misinterpretation, I just felt like some relationships and characters struck me as too unrealistic to draw me in.
This is my first time posting (I tried a few times by using Facebook account but they just say pending), but I've been lurking for months. I appreciate everyone's comments and have picked up great books based on recommendations on here. I even join the Odyssey First Edition book club after someone recommended it on here last Spring.
I do have to say I miss Ed Parks. I consider myself quite progressive on social issues, and I don't know exactly what he said, but I will say that A Little Life is hard to criticize without misinterpretation. Regardless I'm happy you all are still here.
And I just got my copy of "Have you ever had a Family" but haven't cracked it open yet so I'm no help there. I am excited for it though.
Did someone on this forum once present a theory (or even an analysis) on the boost New York-themed books (or New York-based authors) seem to get in the Pulitzer, NBA, NBCC, etc. awards? I was thinking about this in light of the acclaim A Little Life is getting. If someone actually looked at data, was this boost borne out? It wouldn't be surprising. On the other hand, AtLwCS, penned by an Idaho-based writer, was set in the past in Europe. So go figure.
@JohnZ @grahammyers We may have discussed this, but how did you feel it stacked up to Preparation for the Next Life? I haven't yet read AtLWCS.
As it has been with Biography (among other categories), it has also been with Fiction. Adam Johnson won a few years ago for The Orphan Master's Son, and rightly; it is a staggeringly good novel worthy of recognition.
In truth, though, I wouldn't have minded if Joyce Carol Oates had won for Lovely, Dark, Deep.
@grahammyers Great to hear! It is rare to read a novel as good as Lish's, and I completely agree that it should have won the pulitzer.
I'm not sure how I feel about the American Theme emphasis...while you are correct that this is one of the stipulations, it feels anachronistic to me. At the very least, one could argue that it could be applied in a more expansive way given the global nature of our interactions now.
the more i've been thinking about it, i really don't think 'All the Light We Cannot See' deserved the 2015 Pulitzer. it was a fine novel and had some beautiful prose, but it really lacked the 'American themes' vibe that the Pulitzer should award; would have given it to Atticus Lish.
So far, this collection of linked stories is (like his debut novel) getting very good reviews. If he continues to create such beautiful books--each of which has featured uniquely beautiful and evocative writing--I will be shocked if Marra doesn't at some point win every major award.
@BRAKiasaurus @kriscoffield Hello one and all, this is my first post although I've had the pleasure of reading all of your opinions and fantastic suggestions for the past couple of years.
This seems to sum up how I felt about this book: a novel of great promise that it can't quite live up to.
I've been reading A Little Life, and while it hasn't been an awful experience, neither has it been very enlivening. The prose, I am finding, registers as little more than functional. Pervading Yanagihara's voice is a thread of detachment which, thus far, has not served the characters well. Now, perhaps this will change (I do have that hope); however, should it prove not to be true, I cannot say that I expect to experience much in the way of shock.
Some writers compose in a manner that erects a barrier between characters and readers; they present the story as though one were peering through a panel of aquarium glass. This is something I understand; and while I do not prefer it, I have enjoyed (though not loved or revered) novels that are written in such a way.
Anyway, the manner in which the characters in A Little Life have thus far been treated by the author brings back to me the indifference -- sometimes merely chilly; other times, glacial -- which I have observed Egan and Franzen utilizing in their own work. Perhaps Yanagihara felt it was necessary to do this given the exorbitant amount of pain and misery she inflicted upon her characters. Or it could also be the way she chooses to write.
Whichever the reason may be, I'm going to do my best to remain optimistic. That said, there are other novels that have been published this year which are better and more worthy of recognition.
@BRAKiasaurus @grahammyers Only three stories in so far, but I've enjoyed them. Not a lot has happned though yet.
@grahammyers I could see Joy Williams faring very well in any award season. I'm surprised it hasn't already been up--but I'm similarly surprised that David Gates collection hasn't received any notice. How are you enjoying it? I haven't yet read it, even though I was gifted an ARC from goodreads.
@ey814 As someone who lives in Northern California, the drought is interesting to me--using it as the premise for a novel could be great! I might pick it up. There are a few signed copies around.
@BRAKiasaurus Washington Post gave it a good review... I'm with you on dystopian novels, I've sort of had my fill of them...
@BRAKiasaurus @kriscoffield Yep. It was me. I am not usually a satire fan. I rather a "quiet" gut punch of a novel than a belly laugh, honestly, but Paul Beatty put together something really good, and it is a gut punch in the way it confronts racial issues.
@BRAKiasaurus I read THE TURNER HOUSE. It actually had some of the "fearlessness" that I love about some first novels, but it didn't quite gel for me. Still, I am glad it is getting attention. There was enough there for me to believe that Flournoy could produce something even better down the line. My assessment is to pass but watch for her next book.
@BRAKiasaurus And I could've had it. Went back to City Lights before leaving the city, today, but picked up BLACK EARTH instead. For what it's worth, BLACK EARTH–my plane reading back to Hawai'i–will likely be a nonfiction contender for multiple awards. Snyder's reevaluation of the Holocaust in parallel with modern resource depletion is striking.
I, too, am a reader of acknowledgment sections. It's interesting to see how many writers hail from the Iowa Writers' Workshop, or were Michener fellows, etc. I also know how challenging writing can be, so it's always refreshing to see writers who mention those who helped them in getting the book written.
I cannot say I prefer Schteyngart's method. In order to recommend so thoroughly as to write a blurb about it, it's important that one reads the book. If he or she does not, then said blurbs are, to me, suspect. Perhaps others have a greater reverence when it comes to reading and recommending than Gary does.
@kriscoffield Just a heads up, if you scroll down quite a bit, you'll find that jfieds2 read the book.
Anyway, just thought you might want to know. Pretty enthusiastic praise! :).
All of which is to say: it had nothing to do with blurbs. I was similarly happy to see Ed's endorsement of it--he hadn't really seemed terribly thrilled with any of this year's crop of longer fiction, so it his reaction was heartening.
I can't decide how I feel about Gary Schteyngart's method. It's almost like an act of performance art...and is moderately amusing. On the other hand, you could also make the argument that he is perpetuating a problem, not exposing it. Ah well...
I'll tell you this: having met Atticus Lish--a man who was unaware of who Jonathan Franzen was--he is one person whose opinion I will trust. I'm not sure you could buy an insincere quote from him if you tried. (I wish I knew who among this group has read his novel, actually. I think mrbenchly had. Ed started it, but the size of the font was off-putting, as I recall, so I think he put it down.).
When it comes to artists with whose work I'm unfamiliar -- this is when I consider what others artists have written regarding blurbs. But for the blurbs to pique my interest or influence me in any way, they have to come from artists whom I trust.
For example, when I watch a movie trailer, I look for the names of those critics and filmmakers whose work I admire. There are some critics who, it has been revealed, offer positive reviews in exchange for receiving perks. These critics I ignore, for I understand their endorsements are not based purely on the film itself.
Even on this forum, there have been books I've sought out because of endorsements made by other members whose opinions I trust. While he and I did not always see eye-to-eye regarding literature -- what each of us likes, after all, is influenced by aesthetic preferences -- my interest was also piqued when Ed Parks wrote so highly about Did You Ever Have a Family, which played a part in my seeking out the novel during a trip I made to my local bookstore. And, as I've said, the blurbs offered by Mr. Cunningham and Ms. Enright cinched the deal.
I think we've had this conversation before, haha:.
By the way, your revelations about Toni Morrison's "Paradise" we're lovely. :).
Mrbenchly seems weary of Ed's "bemoaning" (and I must admit that I perceived a shift in his general tone after this past year's award toward something a little more antagonistic...it didn't bother me. Kept the forum interesting and active, but I did notice it).
Benchly thanked me recently for steering the conversation back to this year's books, a comment of which I think Ed may have taken note: when ey814 posted an article about prolific writers, Ed prefaced his response with a comment about inviting the ire of those who think this thread shouldn't deviate from speculating about the year's contenders. It is possible that the two (again, one of whom is still here, making me a little tentative to speak for him) were somewhat wary of each other.
I'm going to continue to post away here every day, and I hope Ed decides to return.
On a lighter note, I was going to read Groff's book next, but I may go ahead and dive into Clegg's novel and then Yanagihara's. Both have stirred up some controversy--on and off our site--and I better get to them quickly!!
@BRAKiasaurus @JohnZ @kriscoffield BRAK, thank you for your response. However, saying Ed was not charged with being homophobic is not true. It DID happen (albeit in a veiled manner). Still, that doesn't expunge the intention of the charge.
Understand, if Ed had spoken of certain aspects to be found in Mr. Clegg's novel (viz., gay characters) in a derogatory manner, I wouldn't have had a problem with mrbenchly's post. But as Ed did not do that, and, in fact, said the novel was the best of the year, I found the charge insulting. Also: untrue.
Ed and I did not always agree when it came to books; however, who does? That said, I enjoyed our civil discourse. As a writer myself, I understand the importance of considering views that are sometimes dissimilar to my own -- provided, of course, that people are civil about it and are able to back up what they think with facts. By sharing ideas, by listening as well as offering what we think, makes for enlivening and educational exchanges.
I was excited to post on this forum how much I am enjoying Did You Ever Have a Family, and came home from work with the intention of writing that post and telling Ed that he and I are of a like mind where Mr. Clegg's beautiful novel is concerned.
I saw this in the "Briefly Noted" section of the New Yorker. Piqued my interest. Anyone read it? Considering reading it?
If you do pick it up, it'd be great to hear your thoughts!
@JohnZ @kriscoffield By the way, this:.
"It's important to be discerning before charging another human being as being homophobic, racist, bigoted, etc. And that's exactly what some on this board have done as regards Ed. ".
(Just as an example: this year alone he has brought many, many short story collections to my attention. "Sweet Nothing" by Richard Lange is only on my radar because of EdParks.).
His actual point, I think, was actually just a matter of preference; the language he used to explain the preference, unfortunate.
JohnZ, I understand your reaction here. The internet overreacts to everything.** On the other hand, EdParks overreacted as well. Perhaps he didn't realize that deleting his account would result in the visibly dramatic deletion of all his past comments, and perhaps he will return...Hell! for all I know, he could be the owner of a couple of the accounts that are active on this forum: EdParks may well in fact be the pprize.com's very own Andy Kaufman!
Even if EdParks never returns to us, let us hope that Tony Clifton surfaces in his place. And in the future, let's hope that this forum continues to be a place for speculation and civil debate.
**I don't necessarily agree with you that the "condemnation" was over the top or lacked civility. Mrbenchly simply pointed out what appeared to be a pattern and cited examples. MrBenchly then went on to say that, for him, this pattern undermined EdPark's other literary opinions and lamentations.
To be clear, I am also an ally for those whom society attempts to marginalize and condemn. As for the "bystander effect" to which you referred, I do not support it. Nor should views that propagate stereotypes remain "unchecked" (viz., ignored). What I've observed is that those who do not call out such views do so not out of "civility," but rather out of fear and temerity.
It's important to be discerning before charging another human being as being homophobic, racist, bigoted, etc. And that's exactly what some on this board have done as regards Ed.
To explain why it won't do, I offer some points that will, I think, offer something in the way of amelioration:.
It's too easy to judge others. In fact, it's a more commonplace practice now than it used to be -- a sad truth. However, before people starting throwing stones, they should do their best to understand whether or not their charges have veracity. For words can wound. This is especially so when those words are not entirely accurate.
Understand, my intention is not to be rude. But as you stated in your post, it's wrong to adopt a "bystander view" when you observe actions made by others that may be harmful and divisive.
But the divisions that have been made and continue to be perpetuated -- both in art and the world -- are disheartening. So many borders and restrictions are erected that attempt to pigeonhole and narrow minds that I cannot sometimes help but feel disheartened. There's enough enmity in the world already; one wonders why there are people who wish only to cause more. No doubt it has something to do with fear, willful ignorance, and control.
In order to read, be moved, and informed by Ms. Morrison's work, I do not need to be of a specific type; neither sex nor pigmentation need apply. All I have to be is human, discerning, and capable of empathy. This is what the best art reminds us of again and again.
If I'm not incorrect, Ed's primary problem with A Little Life was that it veered so relentlessly into melodrama. Then, after hearing about the author's intentions regarding the novel (viz., utilizing the elements found in melodrama was an intentional choice), Ed revised his views.
Which is all to say, we do not always have to agree. Provided one does not reduce him- or herself to being offensive or pandering to propaganda and hate, and also provided that he or she offers thoughts and ideas that are well-rounded, it is possible to be in conflict without usurping civility.
Hey everyone! Just curious to know people's take on THE SELLOUT. Saw it at City Lights, almost picked it up. Didn't, opting for some theoretical works to inform my scholarly projects. Worth reading?
I haven't heard much about Jesse Ball's "A Cure for Suicide"...maybe it will fall off the shortlist? Curious if anyone has read it. Same goes for "The Turner House".
(As an aside, I actually don't like the segmentation of literature into race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc. It is all literature--and when fiction is good, it is important, it is beautiful, and it teaches us about own humanity.).
It appears that EdParks has deleted all of his comments on the forum. Strikes me as an overreaction--and a particularly unfortunate one, given that this could instead have been an opportunity to have a more in depth dialogue about the subject.
A curious development--unexpected drama in our little corner of the internet--but I am glad that you, mrbenchly, spoke up. I hadn't yet decided quite how to respond.
@EdParks You'll forgive me if I ignore all of your future comments, but after such archaic statements ("I don't particularly enjoy reading gay fiction"; "It would have been a much better novel if Jude had been a woman"; "I just want her to choose her subject matter more judiciously in the future."), I simply don't care what you think.
For sinking to this level, I apologize to my fellow bibliophiles whose opinions I value immensely, and specifically to Tom. I'm just tired of the monopolization of this forum by the constant bemoaning of someone who has now revealed he thinks a novel about the social and emotional lives of gay men is not a judicious choice. Such telling commentary.
And based on what I have heard about "Purity", I think you are probably correct.
"Fortune Sniles" has been very well-received, but my bet is on "Fates and Furies". Johnson always writes--arguably even in OMS--with a sense of humor and a satirical edge. His first novel was received as basically full of brilliance and energy, but ultimately deemed uneven and often unsuccessful. He takes a lot of risks.
I thought you had come around on "Little Life"? I haven't read it yet, but I remember being surprised to see you even conceding that, we're it to win the Pulitzer, you wouldn't be unhappy with the outcome.
So far, you primarily hoping the award goes to a short story collection?
@EdParks Really glad to hear you enjoyed it!
@BRAKiasaurus i didn't think it particularly special. His whole multi perspective approach has gotten old there are so many problematic thematic problems that it really loses steam. Franzen is a wonderful writer and there are elements that are just a joy to read, but he too often comes off as too smart (or believing he is smarter than he is) and at times that is grating.
I forgot about Zink's and Pearlman's books. Seen "Refund" at the store--even picked it up to review the cover--but it's up against strong contenders. "The Turner House" was not on my radar at all. It is a debut and, just based on its competition, an unlikely winner.
@BRAKiasaurus @EdParks Agree that Fates and Furies seems to be coming on strong. Also give Above the Waterfall a good chance. I think it would be a surprise if Watchman made the list, but one never knows. Books that are published in 2015 are eligible, even if they've not been released yet, so Marra and McCann might show up....
@EdParks @ey814 Must agree with Ed completely. I assume long list is 10? If I had to guess all 10 (admittedly, without having read all of the following), I'd say:.
A Hand Reached Down to Guide Me.
There's Something I Want You to Do.
But there may well be a surprise or two in there. Agree with Ed that "Our Souls at Night" might get a nod, but I would be shocked by "Watchman".
I'm not sure what the rules mandate in this case, either. I assume books that remain as yet unpublished (but which are due to be published this fall) could be eligible? If so, there is a chance that Charles Bock, Garth Risk Hallberg, Anthony Marra, McCann etc., could all find their way into that list.
Okay, National Book Award long list comes out tomorrow. Any predictions? I think we'll see A Little Life, Purity, and Did you Ever Have a Family. What else?
I always enjoy your comments, and I have been lurking for almost a year now. I just want to say I 100% agree with your review of A Little Life, and for me the author's comments were intriguing, but it definitely doesn't fix the novel for me.
I was a bit surprised you didn't love Preparation for the Next Life. I am curious if you are a fan of the author Wally Lamb, if you don't mind me asking.
@EdParks There's so little history of the man booker accepting novels from american writers that it's impossible to know if it will have some impact (positive or negative) on american awards (which tend to be diverse themselve).
So many contradictory opinions about A little life really have me intrigued (at least with so much recognition the probabilities of being published here in Spain increase).
I am 1/2 through THE SUNKEN CATHEDRAL. Although endings can sometimes make me change my entire opinion on a book, so far, I'd have to say, it's the best thing I've read this year. More soon.
I happen to have an ARC of THAT as well! (Gotten lucky on them recently)--a friend is reading it, and then I'm going to. I am very excited as well!
@ey814 I will send you my ARC when I'm finished with it if you'd like. I haven't gotten to it yet, so it may be a month before I'm finished. Let me know if you're interested.
@EdParks @ey814 I really enjoyed her novel that was a finalist for the pulitzer. Strange mix of magical realism and...hm...I don't quite know, honestly. I do recall it having a ghost.
In the meantime, I have an ARC of her new collection, and short stories are what she is most famous for.
As for Smith and King, I go with Mr. King, as well. He deserves more credit for his intelligence, skill, and talent than most people give him. It's nice to see he's finally being celebrated. Anyone in doubt of his writing and storytelling abilities would do well to read (among others) Lisey's Story, The Man in the Black Suit, The Reach, The Dead Zone, and Bag of Bones.
@EdParks (my long, well-written reply didn't post for some reason, so this one may be less well written :-).
Yes, I was thinking of Jeff Bridges as I typed Terms of Endearment, meaning Last Picture Show. I shouldn't rely on my memory! I agree with you completely about Duane, and would love to see a sequel to Picture Show. I lived in Dallas for 20 years and made several trips up to Archer City to see the town and, of course, go to McMurtry's bookstore.
Speaking of which, Joy Williams has a new short story collection out today.
@BRAKiasaurus I guess I would be remiss if we didn't at least throw "Purity" onto this list.
Did anyone else read Charles Bock's debut? I'm curious--given that it has been, what, seven, eight years since his debut--what his second attempt will yield. I think EdParks remained unimpressed with "Beautiful Children", but I haven't heard anyone else's opinions.
It is one of those signed books that has traveled with me through my moves around the country as I followed my career (only to wind up on the west coast in a very literary area), but I only read the first couple chapters. Impressively written, those. But I need to revisit it and read it in its entirety.
I have an ARC of "the visiting privilege"--stay tuned!
Also, I was more excited about Watkins' book before I learned it was a dystopian novel. Oh well, good writer nevertheless.
@jfieds2 Very cool! Will this be the book that gets him the Pulitzer he almost certainly deserves? I'm looking forward to reading it!
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus @JohnZ Again, it's a matter of aesthetics, I think. Given your list of authors, it appears you prefer older works. Which is fine. I enjoy them, too. Anyone who denies him- or herself the pleasure of disappearing into Tolstoy, Melville, Dostoevsky, Fauklner, etc. -- well, that's just unfortunate. Quite sad, too.
So many of the Pulitzer winners in the early part of the last century dealt, on some level or other, with pioneer life. And while my intention isn't to disparage those novels (which offered me much pleasure and insight to a time during which I had not been born to observe and experience) none of them comes close to Lonesome Dove. Mr. Stegner's Angle of Repose comes close, but Lonesome Dove was just too pleasant an experience to knock it down a peg.
@EdParks @JohnZ @BRAKiasaurus One of the added joys of reading that I've discovered is going back to books I haven't read in decades, visiting them again, and discovering how my feelings might (or might not) have changed.
When reading a book, even though the words are the same (aside from translations of Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and the like), everyone "sees" the story through the filter or his or her singular imagination. In addition, we bring our own life experiences and opinions to art. As we grow (one hopes), we change (one hopes), so that going back to something we read long ago becomes a somewhat new -- maybe even heightened -- experience.
As for "getting too old" -- phsaw! As long as we're willing to surrender and have an open mind, we continue to be works-in-progress.
To date, when asked about the funniest novels I've read, A Confederacy of Dunces and Straight Man (Richard Russo) head the list. Should The Feud continue to unfurl as it has thus far, I'm thinking I've another novel to add to my list.
Because of this, I am again re-examing my ambivalence regarding works of art being placed into contention. Great work is great work, after all: it should be recognized as such. Then again, we're a species that enjoys its approbation.
I'll keep my fingers crossed. I like the premise of the book.
@mrbenchly @BRAKiasaurus Agree! I think we have hit a lull, and it has caused more reflection on old titles and, for lack of a better term, regrets. We are thankfully heading into the fall, however, when the heavy hitters tend to be released. And then it's on into the awards season! So far--to unnecessarily summarize--it seems like the favorites (or promising titles) I've heard mentioned are:.
If I'm missing anything, feel free to add on.
I'm passing on "Purity" for now but if a used copy shows up somewhere, I'll consider it. The NPR review of the book by Roxane Gay (which is titled "A Compelling Plot Gives Way to Farce in Franzen's 'Purity'") put me in mind of exactly what puts me off of his work. "But, for every wonderful piece of prose, for every masterful stroke in this novel, there is the stuff that was simply distracting, if not alienating and infuriating. For all its extravagant ambition, the book is full of self-indulgent nonsense.".
Having just read a 930 page book that was both compelling and yet completely uneven, I think I'll pass for now.
"The Incarnations", which will not be eligible for the Pulitzer, sounds incredibly promising. Looking forward to that one. :).
@BRAKiasaurus I have not but I do appreciate you steering the conversation in this 2016 Prediction page back toward one about books published this year. This comment thread has, for the last 8 years, been my radar for potential prize-winners I should read and I appreciate all the tips I can get.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus @JohnZ Perhaps, but I doubt our standards are that different. I'm surprised you would disagree about "Beloved" or "A Death in the Family", Updike's work or "Ironweed". Even if you didn't appreciate them all, certainly there must be at least a handful in JohnZ's list that you believe to be among the best fiction our country has produced?
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus @JohnZ Confederacy of Dunces: Let some time pass, then go back and read it again. It's something special.
@BRAKiasaurus @EdParks @JohnZ What you observed about Rabbit, Run, can, I think, be found in all of the Rabbit books. Each encapsulated a decade -- one during which Mr. Updike kept a notebook and wrote down interesting news stories and details concerning pop culture. It's a series ripe for a time capsule, as there seems to be in it just about everything that reveals what it was like to live in all of the decades the novels considered.
I enjoyed All the Light We Cannot See. Is it the best Pulitzer novel in recent memory? No. But it wasn't a horrible novel.
@BRAKiasaurus @JohnZ @EdParks The Moor's Account is one of the books I've been reading, and it is very good. It's on the Booker long list, too. Lovely prose and imagery.
I'm in agreement concerning Beloved. Considering novels that have been published in the latter part of the century, I think it's the one that will sustain interest, admiration, and dialogue one hundred, two hundred, etc., years from now. The characters, the theme, the structure, the quality of the writing -- an exceptional novel on all counts.
We both know how each of us feels about Lee's book, so we'll leave it at that (ha ha).
I have The Feud and have started to read it. Ah, Berger. Such wit.
@EdParks @JohnZ (Meanwhile, I notice I wrote "cannon" instead of "canon". Now's as good a time as any to say that I share your lament about the inability to edit comments, EdParks.).
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus @JohnZ Yes, the first three you mentioned are absolutely great novels and belong in our cannon.
As to AtLWCS, I haven't read it yet. Still working my way through the crop of this year's books. (For example, I think the next book I will read--as I just finished "City on Fire" and am wrapping three short story collections--will be "The Incarnations" and then, probably, "Saint Maize".).
We won't ever agree on everything. I don't understand why "The Road" won, and we have already argued over my disbelief that Lee Martin's novel would have been a finalist. "Love in Infant Monkeys" was a similarly bizarre choice. "All Souls" has some beautiful writing, but a Pulitzer finalist? I hated "Mean Spirit" when I read it--it has been awhile, so it's possible that I would enjoy it now.
I have All That Is, yet I haven't read it yet. The title has been surfacing in my mind, which is a good indicator that I may soon be reading it.
I would gladly have given the pulitzer to Ben Lerner's 10:04, and I think Stone's "Dog Soldiers" (a finalist, I think, although I don't recall what it was up against) should have won.
I'm interested if anyone has personal choices of his or her own that should have won the Pulitzer. Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment (ha ha), but I always find it a good thing to learn of books that others consider great, books that resonated with them. My library is already extensive (you've no idea!), but I believe in the adage "One can never have enough books.".
So if anyone has specific books or collections that were in contention for the Pulitzer that he or she thinks should have won, please share them.
For entirely different reasons, I was reminded of James Wood's review of "& Sons" wherein he said something along the lines of "Gilbert can't seem to decide what kind of writer he wants to be" and then basically said that the book, while written by a writer of immense talent and potential, didn't live up to its promise, suffered from the writer's own indecision.
Underworld is a mess of a book, but it is brilliant and every page and word works towards its theme. I see why some might have cut parts of it, but I wouldn't have cut anything.
I don't know that I would necessarily cut anything from "City on Fire" either. Rather, I would simply have done what Harper Lee's editor did early on: told him where the potential was and ask for a rewrite.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus Much like The Goldfinch, this book is large, hard to put down, and incredibly uneven.
In fact, the best parts actually take place in the characters' past. Mercer, an african american gay man who is living with the estranged heir to the Hamilton-Sweeney corporation, goes home to the south to see his family. He re-connects with his deviant brother and comes out to him. The moment feels sincere, is very well done, and exposes Hallberg as a writer to be watched--if the entire book were that strong throughout, it would certainly deserve to be in the running.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus @ey814 @grahammyers I would hope that Smiley read the entire novel if she was willing to review it. Her thoroughness notwithstanding, I have read other reviews, each of them heaping praise on this book.
I don't think size will actually affect its potential. It is largely dialogue, and the year The Goldfinch won, it was up with "The Son" and "The Woman Who Lost Her Soul". Three huge novels. My guess is that Vollmann's novel would be put up against two 400-500 page novels, so the page number would likely be similar to 2013.
In any case, I'm not so cynical that I think serious people charged with the simple task of reading 3 books and then voting would shirk such a pleasant responsibility.
@ey814 @EdParks @grahammyers This one is of interest to me and should probably be in the running for this year's prize. His work is often lauded--including the uneven tomes, the best parts of which evidence a potential that (in so far as I can tell from reading reviews) makes the worst parts ever-more disappointing. So to see a book so universally praised this time around....I think there may be something worth keeping an eye on here.
There have been some particularly strong contenders this year that deal with race, particularly on the subject of being black in America. I think we are likely to see at least one of those get a nomination--and if journalists (inexplicably) help pick the winner, the social relevance could well award it the prize. Thinking in particular of "The Sellout" (which I haven't read) and "Braggsville" (which I have).
@ey814 @EdParks @grahammyers Will do my best later this year. :).
@EdParks @grahammyers The Dying Grass was reviewed by Jane Smiley in the NY Times (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/books/review/the-dying-grass-by-william-t-vollmann.html). I'm too am interested in how well its received, I admire the scope and intent. Given my turtle-pace of reading, though, I'm probably not going to read it, so will rely on someone on this list to fill me in!
@EdParks I remember a discussion about David Rhodes when Driftless came out. He is an Iowa Writers' Workshop graduate and had published a number of well regarded novels in the 1970s, one drawing favorable comparison to Sherwood Anderson's "Winesburg, Ohio." Driftless was the first novel he'd published in 30 years, after the accident. Several discussants on the discussion board liked the novel, and I bought a first edition, but didn't end up reading it. I may have to go back to it.
@EdParks I saw this as well. You wonder why someone of Matthiessen's status didn't donate his library/ephemera to a library somewhere, I'm sure there would have been many takers.
I like the cover, and the scope of the book (and its subject matter) is intriguing--sounds like a real deviation from his previous two endeavors. I won't have time to read it until later this year, but I will be keeping an eye on the reviews (including the one we'll likely receive from you, EdParks) to try to decide whether it's a question of "when" instead of "if".
His short story collection is also due out in a couple months!
@BRAKiasaurus I just picked this up and look forward to reading it. I'm sure it will be uncomfortable in some ways but his is a voice that needs to be heard.
Despite the fact that we tend to focus on fiction here, I wanted to quickly give a nod to Ta Nehisi Coates' "Between the World and Me". Essentially an epistolary essay, it is a devastating account of what it means to be black in America. It vacillates between personal anecdotes and broader treatises about racism in America. For example:.
It is powerful, and while it may provide few answers, everyone will come away with a deeper perspective and a new way of asking questions.
I am actually more curious about one of Scout's next publications (out next Spring): "Tuesday Nights in 1980", but I will save that for next year's discussion.
@BRAKiasaurus A smaller trim size would certainly be the first strategy to "bulk" up a short book.
@grahammyers @EdParks I changed my mind and picked it up. He's somewhat local, so I'm going to get him to sign a few books including his new one. Will not read it until later this year; but will let you know when I actually dive in. Honestly, it has gotten the most universally positive reviews of any book--possibly outside of "The Sellout" and "Braggsville"--that I've seen this year.
@EdParks the obscure topics he chooses to write about and the sheer volume of his works puts him out of contention for me. i'm sure he's an excellent writer, but i can't justify reading his books.
@EdParks I too have been keeping an eye on this book...very curious how this book does in the awards season--universally positive (and starred) ratings, from what I've seen. He's an interesting writer! I think I'll probably dive into Europe Central before I buy this tome, however.
@EdParks I got mine from B&N yesterday. It is BIG. Not sure when I'll be ready to read it. David Truer (I think) gave it a great review.
That said, the font size: I prefer a smaller font size, but I also recognize (as someone who wears glasses) that I won't always enjoy that luxury. Interestingly, Anne Enright's novel has really large font. I'm not sure why particularly, although I wonder at times if they do that simply to make short novels seem more substantial? Enright's book received solid reviews, as I recall.
@AlexKerner I'm very curious about A little life, people seem to love or hate that novel. Bill Clegg's first novel is nominated too, Portrait of an addict as a young men is published in Spain (i remember some papers interviewing him a year and a half before it was published here, i remember thinking who is this guy to get such attention from the media).
I'll definitely have to pick up a copy. Hopefully I can find a signed first.
@ChrisEllis77 @BRAKiasaurus BLACK RIVER has stuck with me. It is not perfect, by any means -- it has some problems indicative of first novels -- but besides THE SELLOUT, I haven't read anything else yet that I think has a chance of winning.
I read Mr Tall by Tony Earley a few days ago, some short stories and a novella, very well written, he seems to write a lot around marriage at different stages. maybe he has plentyy of experience there.
Agree with you about the Pulitzer winner this year...it would be nice if the award would go to any deserving novel, particularly an under-recognized or independently published book (as I believe it should have last year with "Preparation for the Next Life".).
I have also read The Shore ,Alex, yes I agree its very good, maybe a chance. The last years I have just waited to last in the year to see who the genral public have been siding and gone for that, from a collectors point of view, it would be nice if something won which did not have a 100,000 in the first print run.
@AlexKerner Haven't read it yet, but the description sounds interesting.
@EdParks @ey814 This is really sad news. I didn't realize his age until recently, when listening to an interview about Andrew's Brain.
@EdParks I'm a big Joe Coomer fan. The Loop is one of my all time favorite books. Also really liked The Decatur Road. Sorry to hear he's having difficulty finding a publisher.
@BRAKiasaurus @Marybethking sure if you can or I can just wait until October!!
In any case, I'm not sure where to obtain a copy offhand, but I am happy to report back about the book. If I happen upon another copy, would you like me to send it your way?
@EdParks I really did enjoy the 'The Bright Forever' as well. I think I did if I'm remembering my reading correctly!
@BRAKiasaurus how or where do you get an advanced copy? thanks!!
Has anyone ever gone backward and read Pulitzer Fiction (Novel) from the beginning and evaluated why they won, or wondered why? I do follow this blog and it always becomes exciting as it reaches the yearly end. Thank you.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus continues to get better...not striking me as a pulitzer book yet, though.
@BRAKiasaurus I finished it last month and thought it was fine. If you're going to read over 900 pages I think you want to like it a little more than just okay. I liked A Little Life infinitely more.
I just finished Infinite Home and loved it. It's scope is pretty small, but the writing is spectacular. I'd love for it to get some attention.
Fates and Furies was also really good. I think it could make some waves as well.
I have copies of Purity, Gold Fame Citrus, and Eileen, all of which I have very high hopes for.
So far, "city on fire" doesn't even remotely strike me as Pulitzer material. It is compelling and hard to put down, but it reminds me vaguely of Donna Tartt meets Richard Price. We will see as I continue--definitely worth picking up to read at this point, but hasn't yet--150 pages in--convinced me that it is worthy of that particular award.
@EdParks i think it is safe to assume that it will not win the Pulitzer.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus @JohnZ She can be, though she often makes very good and fair points about books. I wonder what James Wood is going to say about the novel...such a unique situation, this.
Hmm....Corrigan definitely confirms some of my concerns about this novel. Will have to read it myself to decide if I agree or disagree.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus Ha, I am 30, so I guess relatively young. It is true that my literary eyes are bigger than my stomach, but I usually get to most of the things that are truly important to me.
I have about 10 books going right now, one novel, one non-fiction, 6 or 7 short story collections, and a book or two of poetry, and I tend to read different things in different settings. The train: poetry or short stories, the gym: nonfiction (not sure why), and novels in the evenings and weekends.
But I guess we'll see. You may well be right. I of course will never get to everything, but that indisputable fact does little to quell my voracious appetite. :).
I've been meaning to read The Tunnel--I believe that's often considered his best work?
@EdParks @JohnZ It is true: I have no reason to assume she continued to write. Except that Lee was a writer, and as such, I would be absolutely shocked if she resisted the temptation to continue her craft long after her debut publication albeit in secret.
It was not, as I understand it, the writing she disliked but rather the limelight and (perhaps) the likelihood that no followup would ever live up to "Mockingbird".
Still, readers cannot help but to feel they have a personal stake, and when a writer does something readers with which readers are not comfortable (if not outright angry), it hurts.
The bottom line, I suppose, is that authors can do whatever they want with their creations, and sometimes they take their characters and change them to a degree that knocks the polish off them.
I am not interested in attacking or defending the book prior to its publication (as I said above, I'm far more interested in the editing process and if this will ultimately lead to other works being released). I do agree that it might be timely, if for no other reason than it may have us all reopening "Mockingbird".
While I don't think the racial divide is growing, I think that the internet has illuminated an issue that was always present but previously easier for some to ignore. This novel is perhaps just one more, thankfully non-violent, opportunity for us all to consider the country's legacy and the ways in which those issues persist today.
Even after reading and liking the first chapter of Go Set a Watchman, I have to admit Ms. Kakutani's review has given me pause. I think she, too, was a little stunned by how a character in the novel has been treated. Or is it rendered? For Ms. Kakutani, it seemed rather a timorous review.
Which is all to say, in the coming days, one suspects quite a dialogue is going to be had. And given the current socio-political climate in this nation, perhaps Go Set a Watchman might well provide something in the way of a catalyst. I suppose there's something to be said for synchronicity.
The controversy is moderately interesting to me: from one perspective, she might not have published the novel if this were 20 years ago and her mental faculty was indisputably undiminished. There is a chance that she was, in fact, taken advantage of by the publisher and lawyer; on the other hand, authors who pass away often have their work published and so this may have surfaced, no matter her wishes, after Lee's death regardless.
In that vein, this novel may well be the first in a series of post-humous publications by Lee. I would be shocked if she didn't work on another novel, a set of short stories, etc. Again, we'll see.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus @ey814 Ha, I don't actually think our tastes and interpretations are that divergent. The tempestuous tone of our recent dialogues aside, I tend to enjoy the novels your recommend. (You strike me as someone who puts great effort, as needed, into the novels you read--even going so far as vouching for the allegedly overwritten portions of "The Stones of Summer", suggesting that they are in fact part of the voice of a drug-addled mind--which is why I was honestly surprised by the assertion that Walbert's footnotes were gimmicky or that you wanted a straightforward narrative.).
But I think we tend to agree on most things...and just as a reminder: I am not (yet) an advocate for last year's pulitzer winner. I doubt I will hate it; I also doubt I will read a better book from last year than "Preparation for the Next Life". That would have been my choice, and I'm holding fast to it.
In any case, I liked what I read of Bock's novel--but I had to put it down (I don't recall why)--but it was certainly the "City on Fire" of its year. My friend at McSweeneys was dismayed, as they had released something the same week, and Bock's book sucked all the air out of the room.
Franzen's novel seems to be getting pretty mixed reviews, and (again, a way in which our tastes diverged, I did not care for his last novel).
Very curious about "The New Valley"--going to try to read it at some point in the next few months, I think, when I finish the CoF ARC. His novel did sound strikingly different, so I was curious. Thanks for the opinion!
@EdParks @ey814 I love when they put this stuff out...although there are less exciting things coming out this fall than I would have expected. That said, these lists tend not to be entirely thorough. I'm finishing up "The Sixth Extinction" right now (and I can't recommend it highly enough).
I will start "City on Fire" next--I have received an ARC of it. Will let you know what I think, but I'm very excited to read it.
Colum McCann's book is exciting, as is Marra's--actually Marra's is more exciting to me than McCann's. Not sure if I care about Johnson's collection, but I will likely pick it up as he is local and will inevitably have at least one signing here in the bay area.
I am also interested in Vollmann's book, however I haven't read many of his works, so there's no reason I have to start with this. Will likely pick read "Europe Central" before I read "Grass". Claire Watkins' novel certainly piqued my interest, but David Mitchell's work sounds minor.
They didn't include Kathleen Alcott's "Infinite Home"--which has received a bit of buzz--though perhaps that was on the previous list?
Not even remotely curious about Harper Lee's novel, a book that likely shouldn't have been published but which will likely be of more use to scholars than to anyone else.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus Eh, I don't know. Will let you know what I think--I'm perfectly comfortable being challenged by an atypical structure.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus I don't even remotely require a story to be straightforward in its telling. I also do not feel footnotes to be a gimmick simply because they are rarely used (although many wonderful authors have used them: Wallace, Diaz, etc.). I went to see Walbert speak and she talked about how important it was to her that these be there as interjections, as asides for the reader, things to interrupt the linear train of thought. I think in this case she was crafting an experience--an experience which may be undermined on a device, something she struggled against.
@EdParks Keeping an eye out for Alvar's book...I like to buy locally to support my local bookstores, but for some reason most haven't stocked it. It sounded like one of those books that could fly under the radar and then win lots of awards.
I reached out to a friend who has a City on Fire ARC. I'll let you know what I think when I've received / read it.
@BRAKiasaurus I don't receive ARCs ever (maybe because since I returned to goodreads I haven't written any reviews, not that I wrote many before), but since you mentioned goodreads, feel free to friend me: https://www.goodreads.com/AutumnalFrost I left because I spent too much time on there and had to many "friends" with little or no similar interests. I'd be interested to see what other books my fellow Pulitzer enthusiasts read.
Hey all, I don't know that the moderators want to turn this into a marketplace at all--however, I occasionally find (and buy) or receive ARCs from goodreads, etc. If anyone ever has ARCs or books they're looking for / want to trade, etc., I'd be interested.
It occurred to me, because I recently received a copy of "Everybody Rise" by Stephanie Clifford in the mail from goodreads, and I (like the rest of the world) am looking for an ARC of "City on Fire" without spending too much (since I will buy it when it comes out anyway).
Anyway, just throwing it out there. :).
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus I started the book--it is loose and impressionistic and very well-written. I will see her speak this Thursday, and am very curious how this book which seems playful with structure and form compares to her other work. I have KYOTO and SHORT HISTORY OF WOMEN.
@EdParks @ey814 I am truly saddened by this news, and yet, he lived a long life. I wish "All That Is" had received more much-deserved accolades, because I think he deserves to be recognized by the wider public. I would certainly have been happy if it had--even in a year so full of strong novels--won the Pulitzer.
@EdParks I agree... and am glad! So, did you come to a decision about how many of the Pulitzer winners are, in your estimation, great? I think it's a good question.
@jfieds2 @ey814 I don't know....Kirkus completely contradicts the PW review. I think some people may just be disinclined toward larger novels. In any case, there is certainly a lot of hype around this book, and it is hard to live up to that.
That said, I still think (having read only the excerpts) it is likely the best Pulitzer contender I've heard about this year.
PW is just one publication, but I'd be surprised if any Pulitzer winner had something like that in a review...
Has anyone read or heard about "The Wonder Garden", a collection of short stories which received a star review from Kirkus?
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus And I would like to note that it is a HUGE pet peeve of mine when people who don't finish a book feel entitled to critique it (and therefore dissuade others from reading it). Drives me nuts. It is a rare thing to be presented with quotes, admittedly out of context, in those same reviews...and that is the only reason I lent them any credence whatsoever. But I'm sure I'll get to it sometime.
"Paris, He Said" by Christine Sneed (I haven't read her novels, but her short stories were solid, very promising, and garnered a bit of attention.) This novel got a good review on The Millions. It is out already.
"Fates and Furies" by Lauren Groff. She got a bit of attention a few years back on this forum for "Arcadia". Releases on Sept. 15. Might be worth keeping an eye on.
That said, even had I read Doerr's much-praised ATLWCS, I hardly think it hypocrisy to enjoy one novel and then, in a world of so many indisputably high-quality books, be put off by the writing quality of (and therefore choose not to read) another. If I do read the novel at some point, I am quite confident that I will be capable of understanding. That doesn't mean my opinion of his writing will change.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus Yeah, not sure--I can't judge too much without reading it for myself...reviewers on Amazon seem to be creating long lists--most distinct from each other--of sentences they hated. I must say that I agree with their choices...the writing is just poor in most cases, often due to nothing more than the prolixity of the sentences.
But perhaps there are reason for it. I may get to it one day, but even if I do, I will likely remain wary...
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus Yeah, like I said, the film was really awesome! And it's pretty cool that he got the book reissued on the power of the film alone--additionally, the book seems to have been well-reviewed at the time, simply a victim of circumstance.
That said, these writing samples (found in the one-star reviews on amazon) really put me off:.
But it's possible the book--despite whatever benefit it may have found from some strong editing--is lovely in its totality. I just haven't ever given it a go.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus I really enjoyed that film--the film is fun and really inspiring for book lovers like ourselves. Hoewver, when I looked into the book itself, I was utterly put off by the excerpts in the 1 star comments on amazon....the writing was atrocious.
@EdParks @Marybethking Just got both in the mail. Keep ya posted!
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus Yeah, I don't share your opinion of "Freedom" at all, but sometimes that has more to do with timing. I think there are books which, were I to revisit them, i would experience them completely differently.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus I don't quite recall what piqued my interest in Hale's novel. I will say that I find Iowa Writers' graduates to have a good track record--though perhaps I have lucked out.
I may disagree with your assessment of A Little Life, but we'll see...I feel like I heard some comparison to Franzen at some point, and although "The Corrections" was a fine novel, his followup was disappointing...which is to say: if the comparison stands, I may well find myself in the same camp as you. I read the first few pages and nothing about the writing struck me as the effort of "a major novelist", though the writing wasn't bad. Simply found it uninspiring.
I would say some of the most powerful work I have read over the past decade would be classified as "gay literature"--though I myself see no real reason to give it a label (I find a lot of sub-categorization somewhat troubling, particularly when it goes beyond genre to include theme, race, or creed); "By Nightfall" and "You Are Not a Stranger Here" are two books that come to mind. But I digress...regardless, I'm curious about "A Little Life" and will let you know what I think.
Glad to hear you like Knausguard's work. Looking forward to committing myself to it this year. (A few big books I plan to read this year: the evolution of bruno littlemore, a little life, city on fire...going to try to fit book one of karl ove's opus in, as well....next year, gonna give "Infinite Jest" a go, I think.).
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus This is the tweet to which I referred:.
In Santa Monica, with @AtticusLish, who's taping Bookworm with Michael Silverblatt. The novel will also be a selection of @kcrw's book club.
I'm honestly not sure I would read Knausgaard's work out of order, myself. The opening of Book 1 is very impressive. It describes the way the body shuts down in death. It is the passage that convinced me to pick up the rest of the books.
Lish's book is strong--the writing is just wonderful. At the reading I attended, he was asked about his sentence construction. He responded that he was more concerned with the structure of paragraphs. Where they begin, where they end, how one thought moves into the next. Definitely curious to hear what you think.
@EdParks @Marybethking They release today--will pick them up and let you know my thoughts. I have Robin Black's novel from last year queued up first and am working my way through The Last Flight of Poxyl West, which hasn't captivated my attention...
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus By the way, I read that Atticus Lish had recorded an interview for Bookworm; it hasn't aired yet, so I can't verify, but I think I saw that on Tyrant Books' twitter feed.
@EdParks @Marybethking @BRAKiasaurus Yep, they're releasing super soon.
@BRAKiasaurus do you have any idea as to when these are to be released? I couldn't find either when I searched my library database online.
@EdParks Interesting. I loved Drop City. Haven't been bowled over by much of anything else, and just didn't finish The Women. But, your endorsement convinces me.
By the way, not eligible, but "The Black Snow" by Paul Lynch has gotten some wonderful reviews for its incredible writing. Seems like a book that shouldn't be missed!
I'm looking forward to two forthcoming books:.
@EdParks I've never read Boyle's longer work (I've read some of his short fiction in Mcsweeneys), but he seems to garner a lot of praise. Worth picking this novel up, I gather?
@EdParks Can you elaborate on what you liked about Richard Lange's book? Sounds like he's known for his short stories--but I gather his novels tend to be more genre oriented? Master of capturing different voices?
Do you think it is a pulitzer contender? His previous collection seemed very well-received.
@ey814 Aw, glad to hear it, Ed. I am simply under the impression, however mistaken, that you and I have similar tastes. It is possible to be a voracious reader who consumes books of all sorts (although I, like ey814, am not a fast reader) but who is consistently drawn to particular types of plots or writing. I'll pick "Local Wonders" and "Sweet Nothing" and let you know what I think!
@ChrisEllis77 I'd also like to thank the lot of you. I came for the predictions, and stayed for the chatter.
@ChrisEllis77 Welcome Chris! I'll be interested to hear from the folks on this list about the quality of the writing in this book (versus To Kill a Mockingbird). I wonder how many Advance Reading Copies will be released, if any. Until someone sees the book, seems to me it's all an open question!
So far from this list, I've read 'A Little Life', 'The Harder They Come' and 'Delicious Foods'. 'Delicious Foods' has had the biggest impact on me so far. I would also add 'The Sympathizer' by Viet Thanh Nguyen.
@tklein27 If you hear anything about signed editions, let us know!
Hello all, I have been followng this site for a few years now, and would like to congratulate you on how interesting and useful it is, for both reading and collecting.
Has anyone any ideas or views on it.
@BRAKiasaurus @AlexKerner there are several books this year that are getting lots of praise. It's going to be a good reading year.
But who knows! It might be great. I will be endlessly curious, however, to see how it fares against the expectations and during awards season!
I'll list off the big books that are worth noting and probably paying attention to:.
Well I guess I'll kick things off. Can't wait to read Go Set a Watchman. The cover looks similar to the Mockingbird cover. I imagine there will be a ton of first printings. But there might also be some special signed and numbered editions issued as well.
I read somewhere that Reese Witherspoon will be the reader for the audio version.

Neuro science helps us to look at how the brain operates. The more we know about the brain, the better we can understand how people make decisions and SOMETIMES Why.
We begin our journey with a visual representation of the brain. <br><br>"On assignment for Psychology class, Jackson Mohsenin set out to create an infographic that displayed &amp; explained the major sections of the brain and their functions. The brain is extremely complex, and thus the goal was to communicate just enough without overloading the viewer with information.".
While today we have many cool and relatively high-tech tools to study the inner workings of the brain, such was not always the case. For many thousands of years looking inside of a functioning brain was very near impossible.
So study of the brain was focused on the rare cases of brain injury (imagine a person got hit in the head and subsequent behavior changed), the effect of certain "drugs" on thought, and postmortem dissections.
On the shoulders of giants (Thanks Isaac Newton!).
That does not mean the brain was not studied, only that it was more difficult and less precise than brain study today. There are many (trust me I have spent hours reading them for fun) online timelines that give a historical perspective to how far we have come. Two of my favorite historical examinations are:.
A timeline from Eric Chudler of the University of Washington that goes back thousands of years. The level of detail for any given "event" is low, but very interesting and a great starting point.
The History of the Brain from PBS covers the same material (that's good right!?) but has a bit more description and pictures.
Today we have many ways to study how the brain works. At the risk of oversimplification there are five main ways of doing this:.
EEG-- Electroencephalography (EEG) measures electronic impulses within the brain. This is done by having the person being studied wear a series of sensors on the scalp (often done with a "skull cap") Pictures here. The benefit of this is that it is MUCH cheaper and relatively fast.
Blood tests--these measure levels of various neurotransmitters in the blood. The most important of these include Oxytocin, Serotonin, and Dopamine.
The next few tools "Slides" will cover these in more detail.
A research team from Arizona State University has been engaged in a unique research project. Academics have studied leadership for decades. But leadership remains an area of relative mystery because so much of it is associated with cognitive and emotional response. A new multidisciplinary approach is called leadership neuroscience.
VERY little finance per se, but so interesting I had to include it: "A Canadian man who was believed to have been in a vegetative state for more than a decade, has been able to tell scientists that he is not in any pain. It's the first time an uncommunicative, severely brain-injured patient has been able to give answers clinically relevant to their care.".
Good or bad, we may soon be able to Read Your Mind.
Neuroscience has learned much about the brain's activity and its link to certain thoughts. As Lesley Stahl reports, it may now be possible, on a basic level, to read a person's mind.
When two people are trying to make a deal -- whether they're competing or cooperating -- what's really going on inside their brains? Behavioral economist Colin Camerer shows research that reveals just how little we're able to predict what others are thinking.
While there is some evidence linking violence in general to risk factors such as age, sex, substance abuse, and personality traits such as anger and impulsiveness, over many years, researchers have established that only a very small subset of people suffering from mental illness are likely to commit violent acts.
Listening to music may make the daily commute tolerable, but streaming a story through the headphones can make it disappear. You were home; now you're at your desk: What happened? Storytelling happened, and now scientists have mapped the experience of listening to podcasts, specifically " The Moth Radio Hour," using a scanner to track brain activity.
New technologies are shedding light on biology's greatest unsolved mystery: how the brain really works.

Tomorrow is September 1st, already. How did that happen? Fall is right around the corner, and I know this because the Halloween decorations have already started to hit the shelves and retailers are coming out with pumpkin spice everything (I'm serious; yesterday I saw pumpkin spice almonds in the nut section of the Hellmouth. Bleh!).
I love the fall, so, this is not exactly bad news for me. But, the summer went by so fast! I feel like I blinked and I missed it, and, if my less-than-stellar performance on my bucket list is any indication, I just may have. So, let's get to that list:.
2. Spend as much quality time as possible with the Cub before we deliver him to college. I did pretty well at this one. The Cub worked a full time job, played baseball, and kept up an active social life, but I still made every effort to spend time with him.
4. Re-create the black and white picture that I took of the kids with Jana's crew back in 2008. Oh, my heart, did I ever accomplish this one.
5. Lake time. Yeah...never saw a drop of water this summer. The boat being in dry-dock for the majority of the summer was a major buzz-kill; I'm still irritated by it.
6. Enjoy my 30th high school reunion. Success! I had a great time, and, while I initially said that I didn't have a part in planning it, I did end up hosting that Bloody Mary/Mimosa bar with my old friend, which, actually ended up making the reunion even more fun.
7. Do a deep cleaning of my house, including the closets and attics. Again, give me just a second, ha! ha! ha! ha! Yeah. No.
8. Decide what the hell I'm going to do as an empty-nester. This, my friends, is going to be a work in progress. Please stay tuned.
10. Cherries. Homemade mint chip ice cream. Fresh vegetables from the farmer's market. Well, I ate my body weight in cherries, and, I made a batch of mint chip. I never made it to the farmer's market, but, two out of three ain't bad.
11. Spend some time with The Girls. I am so sad that this particular item didn't get done. But! We have made plans to get together the third weekend in September, and, as I said at the beginning of this post, September starts tomorrow! So, the countdown to Girl Time will commence shortly.
Also commencing shortly: my 2017 Fall Bucket List. How much do you want to bet there is an item about healthy eating and exercise?
Ha! I am nothing if not predictable.
- I'm still watching this show. This is quite possibly a record for me.
- Matt's beard is threatening to take over his face. This situation is threatening his status as the prettiest scenery in the house. Trim that shit down, Matt!
- Matt: "I don't throw my girl under the bus". Hmmm, wonder how long that will last.
- I don't think I've ever been as creeped out by a human being as I am by Kevin. Again; shudder.
- I am beginning to think that Josh lacks an indoor voice.
- Kevin's dismay at the trashed house almost makes me feel sorry for him. Except, he's totally creepy, so, yeah...not so much.
- Seriously, Matt, baby, trim that facial hair.
- And that's it for the showmances this season.
- Man, I hope they send Raven home tomorrow, there won't be anything pretty in the house if Matt is evicted.
Yesterday, my nephew- long known on this blog as the Rebel Without a Pause- welcomed his first child into the world.
Yes, he and his wife are grown adults, theoretically, but, in my mind he'll always be my four-year-old sidekick, learning how to howl at the moon and begging me to read The Rainbow Fish just one more time (for the twentieth time).
Time, man. It's a sneaky bitch.
Today was the Cub's first day of classes, and, he sent me this picture to mark the occasssion.
I was impressed that he went to all the trouble of posing for a picture, let alone making a sign.Then, he confessed that his sister had actually made the sign for him; slipping it into his suitcase while my back was turned the night that we took him to her house to say goodbye.
If they asked for ponies for Christmas, I just might be tempted to buy them each one.
Ok, it's not exactly a hobby, but, I have decided to do something that challenges me as often as possible. And, I started today, with a high mountain hike with Kristi, one of my favorite co-workers.
The waterfalls on the way up were a nice scenic bonus, and, with Kristi as my hiking partner, there was never a moment when I felt judged for my obvious physical limitations.
As a side note, I am really, really out of shape. It's time to address that, especially if I am going to continue to challenge myself in any way, shape, or form that is physical.
Looks like we can expect a return of the Exercise Induced Tourettes any time now.
If we have learned anything in our trips to Hawaii, it's that they are going to take several long days of travel to accomplish. This trip was no different; we left Queen B's house at a little before 9:00 p.m. (following the last family dinner that we will all eat together), and drove through the night to reach the Salt Lake City airport, where we parked the car, reclined the seats, and grabbed two hours of restless sleep before boarding our first plane at 7:20.
The first flight, ironically, delivered us to Denver, where we boarded the second flight, bound for Hawaii. Please don't get me started on the fact that we couldn't find a cheap flight directly from Denver, which still would have resulted in a five hour drive, but, would have saved us the lay-over. I don't understand the economics of air travel, obviously.
Anyway, the flight from Denver to Honolulu took seven hours, at which point we arrived on the island with plenty of time to gather our luggage and rental car, check into our room, and hit Waikiki Beach for a leisurely stroll before dinner at The Cheesecake Factory, where we indulged in the namesake dessert x three.
After dinner, we headed back to the motel for a night of rest before the real festivities began the following morning. And, by festivities, I mean the minutia involved in getting the Man-Cub checked into-and moved into-his dorm room.
Our first stop was the local Bed, Bath & Beyond, where we picked up the Cub's Pack and Hold order, consisting of his bedding, towels, desk lamp, a few microwave accessories, and bathroom organization items (as an aside, this is a really great program; our day would have been a lot more stressful if we hadn't had the option to pick everything out ahead and to have it waiting when we arrived. It saved us quite a bit of time).
Once we had our items, we headed for the Hawaii Loa campus, where check-in was accomplished in less than two minutes, the Cub's official school ID was procured, and our load was transported to the dorm via golf-cart. It really was that simple.
Dinner that night was Godon Biersch, which I mentioned in yesterday's post, and then we dropped the Cub off for his first night as a resident of the dorms.
Wednesday morning, we were up early to attend the convocation ceremony at a theater in downtown Honolulu. It was a grand event, and, one that we wouldn't have wanted to miss. Then, we made the decision to skip the day's orientation sessions, because we had already done everything on the agenda when we visited in June.
Instead, we spent the day driving the North Shore, stopping for pie at Ted's and exploring the Waimea Valley Falls Park area, which, was awesome. It was there that we got to see an ancient Hawaiian dwelling as well as examples of Hawaiian flora that was truly breathtaking. It was an interesting stop and I'm glad we didn't miss it.
On the drive back to Honolulu, we saw a seal, sunning herself on the beach (I know she was a she because she was being watched over by a seal preservation volunteer, who was more than happy to give me some of the details about monk seals and their endangered species designation).
We watched the seal until she made her way back into the water and then we hit the road, again.
Dinner that night was with Cindy, Ken, and their daughter, Madi, who was a doll and with whom the Cub connected, immediately (they made plans to head for the North Shore to jump from the cliffs that we visited back in June). We visited until well past sunset, at which point Hugh and I excused ourselves due to our early flight.

I would be sad about being so easily replaced, but, let's be honest; I'm happy if he's happy. And, Hawaii makes my son very happy.
I just wish it wasn't so freaking far away.
Our trip back took sixteen hours, including a short layover in San Fransisco and the five hour drive from Salt Lake City. I guess it wouldn't be paradise is it was easy to get to.
We got back from Hawaii at 1:00 this morning, after which I crashed for many, many hours, finally waking at 11:30, which, is unheard of for me. In my defense, it was only 7:30 in Hawaii, and, my sleep pattern must still be there, along with my son.
Sooo, now I am adjusting to a new sleep pattern and an empty nest. This shouldn't be uncomfortable at all.
1. The Man-Cub's college campuses and his dorm room are definitely going to be favorites-for the Man-Cub, at least.
Yeah, no need to worry about the two of them doing anything crazy. No need at all.
Anhoodle, they really lucked out with a room that sits on the corner of the building, meaning that they have a private bathroom, despite us having paid for a room with a bathroom shared between four people.
The boys did get a bonus roommate the first night...but we don't think he's cut out for the college life.
3. Exploring the Cub's new home has rapidly become a favorite past time for myself and Hugh. We utilized our rental car to the maximum this trip, and, I'll write an actual post about that, but, it's safe to say that having the freedom to cruise the island was a favorite (which goes a long way in explaining the Cub's excitement at his roommate having a car).
We saw some amazing scenery, dipped our toes in the ocean on two new beaches, explored a botanical garden, hiked to a waterfall, and saw some gorgeous flowers and wildlife, including a seal!
4. I can't lie, I'm already missing my boy, but, knowing that the Cub is happy, fitting in, and excited about his future is the most favorite thing of all, this trip.
This is one of his first Proof of Life selfies (remember, I require Proof of Life, twice a day)...
...he's already killin' it in Hawaii.
It's all Fun and Games Until Someone Pulls a Hammy...

I wanted to say thanks to everyone at the Diesel Fueling Station. I ended my residency there today and brought all my stuff home. They were amazing to work with and I hope we can do something together again in the future.
This one isn't exactly new. I finished it a little while back but haven't posted it here. Here's a Dr Who and Dr Dre mashup. Currently availble as a print on canvas and a magnet. If you're interested please send me an email.
Huge thanks to everyone that made it out to the show at the Diesel Fueling Station this past Friday night. The folks at Diesel were fantastic and I had a blast. The paintings will be there for about a month before switching out to a different artist. If you saw something you liked but didn't get a chance to grab it please send me an email. THANKS!
I will have my 1st solo art show of 2015 this coming Friday (2/6) at the Diesel Fueling Station in Virginia Highlands. It will start at 7pm and will have music provided by DJ Rev Andy.
I'll have paintings on the walls and I will be set up with prints and magnets. Hope you can make it. Should be a blast! The paintings will stay up for about a month after the show.
Here's an Andy Warhol. take on Wonder Woman that I just finished. These are always fun to do and I've done a Princess Leia and Ron Swanson in the same style before.
I made this guy over the holiday break. All the equations in the background are actual calculus equations. This is my 5th robot and I think I have a few more left in me. You can see the others here: #1, #2, #3, and #4. I'll have prints and magnets of this one available soon. Shoot me an email if you're interested.

Moving to K-W can be confusing for anybody: how can you explain King Street, that runs north, south, east and west ?! Or streets like King and Weber, that are sometimes parallel, and yet cross each other in two places ? For someone new to the country, adjusting to life here can be even much more confusing.
The Centre focuses on two main areas in its work. First it tries to help immigrants with whatever they need in order to participate in their new life. Second, it helps community members to adjust to its changing face.
To help the community welcome those new to the area, the Centre provides seminars and workshops for community groups, businesses, and schools.
Just in case you are getting the impression that it’s all work and no fun, let me remind you of the Multicultural Festival, which is held every year at Victoria Park during the Canada Day (July 1) weekend. For two fun-filled days, the whole family can enjoy crafts, traditional dancing and especially foods from around the world ! This event is something Kitchener-Waterloo always looks forward to.

After sensors have been turned on Intermittent setting, it is not possible to change their setting in the future. Even if a player turns them either on or off, the Intermittent setting returns. Apparently, this is only problematic for multi-player games and does not present itself in solitaire games.
Any weapon that has a range less than 1.0 nm, cannot be fired by the AI. However, the player is able to utilize these weapons manually and they appear to operate at the correct range. I do not know if missions created by the player will suffer this restriction, but I suspect that they will since Missions are under AI control.
After victory has been awarded to a player in solitaire mode, if the player elects to continue, a Multi-Player Chat Window opens when he selects "Yes".
Units that turn off their radar can still show up as being jammed with the "X" next to their icon.
Unit is unable to plot a course that enables it to leave port and proceed to Formation patrol zone.
EmCon status of units does not match the EmCon state shown in Unit display and there is no way to turn it off..
Planes were added to a base and assigned to a mission. However, they disappear and access through the Mission editor is not possible.
Runways can be reduced, but not be destroyed by nuclear weapons.

Stevens was inside the Brooks House the day after a five-alarm fire in 2011 caused significant damage to the historic 1871 building, and he has been working almost three years to stabilize and rebuild it.
During a tour of the Brooks House Thursday he pointed out the painted Sheetrock walls which represent an important milestone in the $24 million rehabilitation project.
"When you see Sheetrock it means you're in the home stretch," he said. "We're in good shape. We are where we need to be and I am optimistic that it is all going to be done on time.".
An electrical fire started in the Brooks House on April 17, 2011, damaging the historic Main Street building.
Water from the fire fighting teams caused further damage, and the building has been vacant ever since.
After working almost a full year to put together a financing package to rehabilitate the structure, Stevens and his four partners closed on the property in July 2013, and work crews have been on site ever since.
On Thursday the Brooks House Development Team led a group of supporters, business leaders and members of the media through the Brooks House.
But he said for the most part the work has been progressing, and on any given day up to 100 workers are on the site among the building's four stories.
The colleges are expected to bring about 350 students and another 50 staff members into downtown everyday that there are classes.
The scope of the massive project was evident during the tour, with 143-year-old brick walls and columns visible through steel joists and frame work that will support the new walls that are being installed.
Stevens said some of the apartments are still available, and not all of the retail spaces have been rented.
Still he said interest in the apartments and in the retail spaces continues to grow, and Stevens said he was not concerned with how empty spaces would affect the development team's ability to meet its financial obligations.
The team in investing up to $24 million in the re-development project, even though the property is expected to be assessed at about $8 million.
When all of the work is done the 80,000 square-feet in the Brooks House will have been completely renovated and refurbished.
"It's all new," Stevens said. "It's going to be an all-new building inside the old shell.".
The restored lobby will lead to a two-story atrium.

I will also be available for tutorials by request.

Internally, the book is divided into three main sections: an introduction to the history of the typewriter and its art; an expansive plate section showing key works and a dense reference section featuring biographies of the genre’s most influential artists and writers.

HERE IS A SELECTION OF OUR RECENT PRESS CUTTINGS….

Looking for a few great books to share with the young ones this holiday? Here are a few favorites from my time as a teacher and school librarian {and now, as a mom.} A little activity follows each summary if you’d like something thematic that ties into the story. Happy reading!
This beautiful book with simple rhyming text shows animals getting ready because “someone” is coming to their house. On the last few pages you see it is Mary and Joseph. The woodblock illustrations and lyrical wording make it a quick but touching read. One of my favorites for sure, and the kids loves the animals. Describes the nativity in a simple but meaningful way for younger ones. A perfect starting point for talking about the story of Christmas. Read it before setting up your own nativity!
*note: I’m linking this to Amazon but have no idea what the price is so high.
Stop the presses! Polar Express is a good Christmas book! I know you know that already, but I couldn’t keep this classic off the list. It’s special no matter how many times you read it. Have a jingle bell ready to gift to the young one you are reading it with– bonus points for pretending you can’t hear when they jingle it!
Jan Brett has illustrations that will have you finding something new each time you look at them! While these aren’t specifically “Christmas” related, gingerbread is certainly a holiday tradition. Look for lots of wonderful surprises hidden in the illustrations in this favorite book! Gingerbread Baby also comes in a board book format. Now, go bake some gingerbread as a tie-in and you’ll have a friend forever.
Yes, this won’t win any awards but for the infant set it is perfect. Touch Santa’s beard, look in the shiny ornaments, and more! Noodle loves to repeat all the adjectives, so after we read we look for things around the house with those same qualities.
By special request of my husband I am including this. It was his favorite as a child, and when we looked it up a few years ago found that the only copies that existed were considered “vintage” and ran about $200. It’s been republished so *someone* might be getting it in his stocking this year! Sounds like another excuse to go bake some cookies… with sprinkles, of course.
I know, it’s not a Christmas book. However, the toy collection of the main character rivals that of a major department store– and in a season of abundance you’ll soon see it ties in perfectly with the theme of “less is more“. Read it before doing a toy room clean-out and donating unused toys– a perfect chore before Santa comes for a visit!
Every year, this tree gets passed over by families looking for the perfect tree. As he grows taller and taller his hopes fade that he’ll be that tree for someone special. His woodland friends show him the meaning of friendship as they help him realize his dream! Make paper trees for your mantel or table in honor of this noble tree. Or, go out and decorate a tree outside with items from nature. Forces you to get creative!
What are your favorite holiday books? Any that you must read each year? Please share!
These books sound great. I’m going to see if the library has some of them.
Nothing’s better than a good book for children.
@drama queens mum: we were just at the library, scouting out more books! I bet they do have them… love the library!
These are great selections! I haven’t seen A Wish to Be a Christmas Tree. I am going to add that to the collection. One that I love is Auntie Claus by Elise Primavera. I used to read it to my 4th graders. They must have liked it…every copy got permanently borrowed. I hope you and your family have a very Merry Christmas!
I googled Christmas book list and look what popped up. I should’ve remembered you had a list. I think some of these will be added to our advent book list. Thanks for the recommendations.

Random musings on everything from music, sports, and just general stupidity, from a person that probably thinks too much...
You know why I love football season? Besides actually having something to do during the day on Sundays, there is always some great drama. And we all know that the best drama involves large sweaty men all angry from steroids. Its basically like a giant soap opera for guys that also involves hitting, jock straps, and an oblong ball... Wait, did I just say that?
"I'll go on record as saying that Terrell Owens vs. Pac Man Jones is the most emotionally unstable one-on-one matchup in NFL history. I'd have loved to hear their pre-game conversation:.
Sounds about right to me... Where else do you get such emotional complexity besides a middle school or a telenovela?
I mean, what is there not to love? Football has everything one could ask for. And just wait until this Sunday. I hear that Philly fans have been working on a chant for T.O. that involves the letters O and D....
Does anyone else wonder how long it took them to come up with that? Do you think there was an Eagle Fan forum composed of 20 fat, sweaty men that spent hours locked in a poorly ventilated, underground room debating what would be the most effective way to get to T.O.'s psyche? Was it similar to the signing of the Declaration of Independence? I bet it was probably a little more intense... Hopefully the strain of remembering all the different letters doesn't get to them and they start chanting "T.D." whenever Owens has the ball... (Yea, yea... I know it's easy to pick on Eagles fans).
Either way...I sure do miss the cleverness of Philly fans (Who have the best "cheer" in football) now that I don't live there anymore...

When would you like to visit The Lodge at Lakeline Village?

For free version, install the latest version of the plugin from WordPress.org plugin repository.
For Premium, download the latest version from Relevanssi.com and either upload the zip file using the WordPress plugin installation or unzip it and upload the files with FTP in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
Relevanssi doesn’t come with a search widget. You can use the default WordPress search widget or any other method that generates a standards-compliant search form.
Enter your API key here to enable automatic updates and PDF indexing. API key can be found here on Relevanssi.com – it’s in the sidebar when you’re logged in.
If this option is enabled, Relevanssi will index author display names. Searching for an author will find all posts written by the author.
Enter an integer. Words shorter than this many characters are not indexed. The default value 3 is pretty good for English, for other languages other values may make sense.
By default Relevanssi removes some punctuation completely and replaces the rest with spaces. These fields give you control over the most common punctuation types: ampersands, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and quotes. You can define the behaviour for all of these classes. The correct settings depend on what kind of content you want to search, but the default values make sense in most cases.
By default Relevanssi sends a link to the PDF to the reading service, which then downloads the PDF and reads it. However, if your files are behind a firewall, in an intranet or otherwise not accessible from the outside world, this is not going to work. In that case, check this option, and Relevanssi will upload the files directly.
If you have chosen AND as the default operator and the search finds no results, Relevanssi will perform an OR search with the same search terms. If you want to disable this, check this option.
The search term has to be either in the beginning or the end of the word, so searching for “ion” will find “caution” or “ionized”, but not “cautionary”.
If you want to emphasize something, don’t be afraid of using big numbers. If you want to make sure that posts with the search terms in titles come up in the search, slap a weight of 100 or 1000 for the titles. Subtlety is overrated.
If you’ve added extra weight for recent posts, this option determines which posts are considered recent.
If you check this option, custom post types which have exclude_from_search set to true will be excluded from the search. If the option is unchecked, Relevanssi won’t respect that setting and will search anything that is indexed.
On large sites searches can become heavy to process, particularly when there are common words involved. Relevanssi has to load every post that is found by any search term, and that can require lots of memory. In most cases, the user only cares about the few posts on the first page of search results.
If you want to restrict search to a particular category, you can do it here.
If you want to permanently exclude posts or pages from search, you can list their numeric IDs here. In Premium, you can also use a checkbox on the edit pages to exclude posts. That is easier to use and works in multisite searches, unlike this option.
If you enable logging, then you’ll find the searches logged and presented in Dashboard > User searches. Logs are necessary for the Did you mean function to work in the free version.
If you want to disable logging for particular users (like yourself), add a list of comma-separated numeric user IDs or login names here. “admin” is a good start, unless you’ve changed the main user login name.
The log database can get large. It is possible to automatically trim the logs. Enter a number here, and the logs older than that many days will be automatically removed.
Choose the length of the excerpt, either in words or in characters. Use words, it’s many times faster than using characters.
If you enable this option, Relevanssi highlights query terms in comment text, when you open the post from the search results page.
Most people need not uncheck this, but if you’re using for example Cyrillic alphabet and the highlighting doesn’t work properly, unchecking this option will help. By default the highlighting regexp is using word boundary markers, and those do not always work properly with non-ASCII characters.
If this is checked, Relevanssi will add extra information in the end of the search result excerpts.
Synonyms can be used to make search more powerful. If you have for example lots of abbreviations in your posts, but some posts use the non-abbreviated form, you can make those two synonyms for each other. Searching for one will find the other.
Stopwords are words that are not indexed. Large part of any text will consist of support words that are pointless for searching. Those meaningless words would still be the biggest part of the index, were they left in.
25 most common words in the index.
This list shows the 25 most common words in your index. These words often make good stopword material, so if you want to, you can click the icon after the word to make it a stopword.
Hi, What can I do if my theme has no search functionality? http://themeforest.net/item/heal-responsive-medical-wordpress-theme/3127829?sso?WT.ac=search_item&WT.seg_1=search_item&WT.z_author=raybreaker.
So, with your theme, we just use the default search widget? Or…do we add it somewhere? This could be made more clear in the documentation for us n00b users. You went in depth on everything else – but this.
Yes, just use the default search widget. It is not mentioned, because in most cases, you really have to do nothing – just use the search widget your theme already has, and most themes do have one.
It’s still incredibly confusing. Most plugins come with their own widget, so not mentioning it at all, anywhere, is not really helping 🙂.
Hi Mikko, I just tried to install the free version but am not seeing any changes in the search widget. I have a premium theme from Solostream (Wp-Mysterious) and also I have checked the “Use Search for Admin” box. What do I need to do to get this to work?
The search result page stays the same.
However I can’t seem to get synonyms to work. I’m trying to get searches for prioritization to show results including prioritisation so entered:.
I don’t know of such synonym library.
What do you mean “nothing happened”? Does your blog load the search page at all?
Looks like the search works on that site.
Did you use the search box in the header and it works?
Yeah, the search box worked just as expected, and the results seemed sensible: http://truliluli.ro/?s=sherlock.
Hmmm, but do not work like here http://www.mindtheproduct.com or here http://www.filmsforaction.org/ for example … And i dont understand why.
I can’t seem to get synonyms to work either. I’ve entered.
But I still get 0 results if I search on “obits,” even though “obituaries” gets pages and pages of results.
OH I get it now. Yes, I was using AND search. In your previous answers I wasn’t realizing you meant as a total setting, not an individual query. Sorry about that! And thanks.
Hi Mikko. My client would like the search results to show the relevancy score,YET have the results displayed by DATE. I have selected this option in the settings: Default order for results: POST DATE. But it is still displaying by RELEVANCE. Any thoughts? can you help?
No idea, changing the setting should change the order immediately. Displaying the relevancy score should have nothing to do with that.
Bad_Self, read this post: http://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/words-ampersands-cant-found/.
I am trying to exclude some pages with “Exclude these posts/pages from search:”. But it doesn’t work. Pages continue appearing on searches. These pages would be “635, 298, 639, 379, 294, 668, 1782, 147, 2920, 2874”. Some solution?
Are you running the latest version of Relevanssi? Are you sure that your search results are coming from Relevanssi?
Versión 3.3.5. I am not sure at all, but I think It’s running via Relevanssi. Our web is tavad.com. Can u check?
I can’t even get to a search results page from the search.
Ok, now I’m seeing a search results page. Looks like Relevanssi, yes. As for the exclusion not working – I’m not sure. There shouldn’t be any reason for it not to work; I just tested it on my test blog, and the feature works just fine.
I haven’t got any posts of myself on it yet, just some demo posts. So you can try searching for ’email’ or ‘mobile’ to see how the results look like.
Hi! Is there any documentation on how to do this?
i would like to disable indexing of post excerpts. Is it possible?
It’s an option you need to enable in Relevanssi settings in the first place.
I did, but post excerpts are still indexed and this is a problem for me. Can you think of anything that went wrong?
Thanks, will fix this in the next version.
Thanks for the update, Mikko. I am now able to add stopwords like “aren’t” but still can’t remove the old ones, same error. Any suggestions? Perhaps manually remove them from the DB?
Yeah, manual is probably the best.
Installed relevanssi and can’t get the synonyms to work either. I have the default operator on “OR” so I can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong.
What are the extra steps? I’m using Forever Wood – is that a problem?
But the easiest thing is to just disable Relevanssi and see if the results change. Do that first.
Are those form entries posts in the WP database? If not, the answer is no.
No they aren’t posts – I’m new to this – so should I put the spreadsheet in a post somehow and just not show that post?
Explain what you’re trying to do, what should be found in searches and what not, and what is the exact nature of your problem. I don’t quite understand what is your problem now.
Looks like this is some bug in Relevanssi. I’ll have to investigate. I’ll try to fix this for the next version of Relevanssi.
Hey! I’m not sure if you fixed this yet. I have the same problem when searching for pages in the actual pages section. Relevanssi turned on for admin simply returns 0 results.
Yes, this was fixed. Are you using the latest version of Relevanssi?
Is there a way to prioritize pages over blog posts with the premium account?
If the Chinese text is in UTF-8, Relevanssi can read it and index it. However, Relevanssi simply does not work with Chinese or Japanese: these languages do not separate words in a way Relevanssi understands. Thus, even if you could index the contents, they wouldn’t make any sense. So unfortunately you have to forget about using Relevanssi with Chinese or Japanese.
Thank you for your excellent work and plugin.
Max, that is not a Relevanssi feature. It’s coming from your theme. You need to edit your theme search results template to fix the issue.
1. What is the latest version of PHP you are supporting?
Stephen, since you’re a Premium customer, go to the support page and send me a support request there, with more details of the problem. What exactly is the problem with the shortcode?
Ville, no, this is the first complaint I’ve heard. What kind of settings you have, and how big is your database? 502 usually means the search is too heavy for the server.
I’m happy debug a bit more in order to find out the real issue but at least I can enable the plugin again.
Happy to say that Relevanssi has nothing to do with this, this was a problem with the theme.
Omer, CDN should have no effect on this; caching may, I suppose. No idea how that would actually have an effect.
I was searching for its widget, when I guessed it could work with the existing search widget.
I was just wondering if it’s possible to make Relevanssi show results only when the beginning of the word matches the search term?

are just an extension of natural breeding, and have no risks different from naturally bred crops.
However, a large and growing body of scientifc research and on-the-ground experience indicate that GMOs fail to live.
are laboratory-made and, once released, harmful GMOs cannot be recalled from the environment.
outdated technology. They present risks that we need not incur, given the availability of effective, scientifically proven,.
energy-efficient and safe ways of meeting current and future global food needs.
documenting the limitations and risks of GM crops and the many safer, more effective alternatives available today.
Because of this, any health effects from a GM food would have to meet unusual conditions before they would be noticed. The health effects would have to:.
• occur immediately after eating a food that was known to be GM (in spite of its not being labeled). This kind of response is called acute toxicity.
• cause symptoms that are completely different from common diseases. If GM foods caused a rise in common or slow-onset diseases like allergies or cancer, nobody would know what caused the rise.
• be dramatic and obvious to the naked eye. Nobody examines a person’s body tissues with a microscope for harm after they eat a GM food. But just this type of examination is needed to give early warning of problems such as pre-cancerous changes.
To detect important but more subtle effects on health, or effects that take time to appear (chronic effects), long-term controlled studies on larger populations are required.
Under current conditions, moderate or slow-onset health effects of GM foods could take decades to become known, just as it took decades for the damaging effects of trans-fats (another type of artificial food) to be recognized. ‘Slow poison’ effects from trans-fats have caused millions of premature deaths across the world6 .
Another reason why any harmful effects of GM foods will be slow to surface and less obvious is because, even in the United States, which has the longest history of GM crop consumption, GM foods account for only a small part of the US diet (maize is less than 15% and soya bean products are less than 5%).
Nevertheless, there are signs that all is not well with the US food supply. A report by the US Centers for Disease Control shows that food-related illnesses increased 2- to 10-fold in the years between 1994 (just before GM food was commercialized) and 19997 . Is there a link with GM food? No one knows, because studies on humans have not been done.
Although studies on humans have not been done, scientists are reporting a growing number of studies that examine the effects of GM foods on laboratory animals. These studies, summarized below, raise serious concerns regarding the safety of GM foods for humans as well as animals.
• Mice fed GM insecticide-producing maize over four generations showed a buildup of abnormal structural changes in various organs (liver, spleen, pancreas), major changes in the pattern of gene function in the gut, reflecting disturbances in the chemistry of this organ system (e.g. in cholesterol production, protein production and breakdown), and, most significantly, reduced fertility19.
The following problems have been found:.
• GM DNA in feed is taken up by the animal’s organs. Small amounts of GM DNA appear in the milk and meat that people eat24 25 26. The effects on the health of the animals and the people who eat them have not been researched.
Do Animal Feeding Studies Highlight Potential Health Problems For People?
But GM crops that caused ill effects in experimental animals have been approved for commercialization in many countries. This suggests that less rigorous standards are being used to evaluate the safety of GM crops than for new medicines.
In fact, in at least one country – the United States – safety assessment of GMOs is voluntary and not required by law, although, to date, all GMOs have undergone voluntary review. In virtually all countries, safety assessment is not scientifically rigorous. For instance, the animal feeding studies that GM crop developers routinely conduct to demonstrate the safety of their products are too short in duration and use too few subjects to reliably detect important harmful effects.27.
While industry conducts less than rigorous studies on its own GM products, 28 it has, in parallel, systematically and persistently interfered with the ability of independent scientists to conduct more rigorous and incisive independent research on GMOs. Comparative and basic agronomic studies on GMOs, assessments of safety and composition, and assessments of environmental impact have all been restricted and suppressed by the biotechnology industry.29 30.
The industry and its allies also use a range of public relations strategies to discredit and/or muzzle scientists who do publish research that is critical of GM crops.33.
• In the late 1980s, a food supplement produced using GM bacteria was toxic41, initially killing 37 Americans and making more than 5,000 others seriously ill.
GM companies focus on producing cash crops for animal feed and biofuels for affluent countries, not food for people.
GM crops contribute to the expansion of industrial agriculture and the decline of the small farmer around the world. This is a serious development as there is abundant evidence that small farms are more efficient than large ones, producing more crops per hectare of land48 49 50 51 52.
In the study, Dr Gurian-Sherman distinguishes between intrinsic yield (also called potential yield), defined as the highest yield which can be achieved under ideal conditions, with operational yield, the yield achieved under normal field conditions when the farmer factors in crop reductions due to pests, drought, or other environmental stresses.
The author concludes: “commercial GE crops have made no inroads so far into raising the intrinsic or potential yield of any crop. By contrast, traditional breeding has been spectacularly successful in this regard; it can be solely credited with the intrinsic yield increases in the United States and other parts of the world that characterized the agriculture of the twentieth century.”59.
“If we are going to make headway in combating hunger due to overpopulation and climate change, we will need to increase crop yields,” says Dr Gurian-Sherman. “Traditional breeding outperforms genetic engineering hands down.”61.
If GM cannot improve intrinsic (potential) yield even in the affluent United States, where high-input, irrigated, heavily subsidized farming is the norm, it would seem irresponsible to assume that it would improve yields in the developing world, where increased food production is most needed. Initiatives promoting GM crops for the developing world are experimental and appear to be founded on expectations that are not consistent with data obtained in the West.
In the West, crop failure is often underwritten by governments, which bail out farmers with compensation. Such support systems are rare in the developing world. There, farmers may literally bet their farms and their entire livelihoods on a crop. Failure can have severe consequences.
Industrial agriculture is a major contributor to global warming, producing up to 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, and some methods of increasing yield can exacerbate this negative impact. For example, crops that achieve higher intrinsic yield often need more fossil fuel based nitrogen fertilizer, some of which is converted by soil microbes into nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Minimizing global agriculture’s future climate impact will require investment in systems of agriculture less dependent on industrial fertilizers and agroecological methods of improving soil water-holding capacity and resilience.
GM seeds are created by agrochemical companies and are heavily dependent on costly external inputs such as synthetic fertilizer, herbicides, and pesticides. It would seem risky to promote such crops in the face of climate change.
According to some analysts, peak oil, when the maximum rate of global petroleum extraction is reached, has already arrived. This will have drastic effects on the type of agriculture we practice. GM crops are designed to be used with synthetic herbicides and fertilizers. But synthetic pesticides are made from oil and synthetic fertilizer from natural gas. Both these fossil fuels are running out fast, as are phosphates, a major ingredient of synthetic fertilizers.
Farming based on the current US GM and chemical model that depends on these fossil fuel-based inputs will become increasingly expensive and unsustainable. The statistics tell the story:.
• Approximately 7.2 quads of fossil energy are consumed in the production of crops and livestock in the U.S. each year.74 75.
• Approximately 8 million kcal/ha are required to produce an average corn crop and other similar crops.76.
• Two-thirds of the energy used in crop production is for fertilizers and mechanization.77.
Proven technologies that can reduce the amount of fossil energy used in farming include reducing fertilizer applications, selecting farm machinery appropriate for each task, managing soil for conservation, limiting irrigation, and organic farming techniques.78.
Climate change brings sudden, extreme, and unpredictable changes in weather. If we are to survive, the crop base needs to be as flexible, resilient and diverse as possible. GM technology offers just the opposite – a narrowing of crop diversity and an inflexible technology that requires years and millions of dollars in investment for each new variety.
Each GM crop is tailor-made to fit a particular niche. With climate change, no one knows what kind of niches will exist and where. The best way to insure against the destructive effects of climate change is to plant a wide variety of highperforming crops that are genetically diverse.
GM companies have patented plant genes that they believe are involved in tolerance to drought, heat, flooding, and salinity – but have not succeeded in using these genes to produce a single new crop with these properties. This is because these functions are highly complex and involve many different genes working together in a precisely regulated way. It is beyond existing GM technology to engineer crops with these sophisticated, delicately regulated gene networks for improved tolerance traits.
Conventional natural cross-breeding, which works holistically, is much better adapted to achieving this aim, using the many varieties of virtually every common crop that tolerate drought, heat, flooding, and salinity.
In addition, advances in plant breeding have been made using marker-assisted selection (MAS), a largely uncontroversial branch of biotechnology that can speed up the natural breeding process by identifying important genes. MAS does not involve the risks and uncertainties of genetic engineering.
The controversies that exist around MAS relate to gene patenting issues. It is important for developing countries to consider the implications of patent ownership relating to such crops.
If it is accepted that niche speciality crops may be useful in helping adaptation to climate change, there are better ways of creating them than genetic engineering. Conventional breeding and marker-assisted selection have produced many advances in breeding speciality crops, though these have garnered only a fraction of the publicity given to often speculative claims of GM miracles.
Both claims require further analysis.
All of these chemicals are toxic and a threat to both the farmers who apply them and the people and livestock that eat the produce. This is the case even for Roundup, which has been shown to have a range of damaging cellular effects indicating toxicity at levels similar to those found on crops engineered to be resistant to the herbicide90.
In China and India, Bt cotton was initially effective in suppressing the boll weevil. But secondary pests, especially mirids and mealy bugs, that are highly resistant to Bt toxin, soon took its place. The farmers suffered massive crop losses and had to apply costly pesticides, wiping out their profit margins100 101 102 103. Such developments are likely to be more damaging to farmers in developing countries, who cannot afford expensive inputs.
In Argentina, the massive conversion of agriculture to GM soya production has had disastrous effects on rural social and economic structures. It has damaged food security and caused a range of environmental problems, including the spread of herbicide-resistant weeds, soil depletion, and increased pests and diseases107 108.
This not only has significant agroecological effects, but also serious economic effects, damaging the ability of organic farmers to receive premiums, and blocking export markets to countries that have strict regulations regarding GM contamination.
Here are a few examples of GM contamination incidents:.
• In 2007 alone, there were 39 new instances of GM contamination in 23 countries, and 216 incidents have been reported since 2005122.
Many authoritative sources, including the IAASTD report on the future of agriculture123, have found that GM crops have little to offer global agriculture and the challenges of poverty, hunger and climate change, because better alternatives are available. These go by many names, including integrated pest management (IPM), organic, sustainable, low-input, non-chemical pest management (NPM) and agroecological farming, but extend beyond the boundaries of any particular category. Projects employing these sustainable strategies in the developing world have produced dramatic increases in yields and food security124 125 126 127 128 129.
• Sustainable, low-input, energy-saving practices that conserve and build soil, conserve water, and enhance natural pest resistance and resilience in crops.
• Innovative farming methods that minimize or eliminate costly chemical pesticides and fertilizers.
• Use of thousands of traditional varieties of each major food crop, which are naturally adapted to stresses such as drought, heat, harsh weather conditions, flooding, salinity, poor soil, and pests and diseases130.
There seems little reason to gamble with the livelihoods of poor farmers by persuading them to grow experimental GM crops when tried-and-tested, inexpensive methods of increasing food production are readily available. Several recent studies have shown that low-input methods such as organic can dramatically improve yields in African countries, along with other benefits. Such methods have the advantage of being knowledge-based rather than costly input-based. As a result they are more accessible to poor farmers than the more expensive technologies (which often have not helped in the past).
Poverty is a major contributory factor to food insecurity. According to the 2008 United Nations report, “Organic Agriculture and Food Security in Africa”, organic farming has a positive impact on poverty in a variety of ways. Farmers benefit from:.
• cash savings, as organic farming does not require costly pesticides and fertilizers;.
• premium prices for certified organic produce, obtained primarily in Africa for export but also for domestic markets; and.
• added value to organic products through processing activities.
These findings are backed up by studies from Asia and Latin America that concluded that organic farming can reduce poverty in an environmentally friendly way.135.
A recent study found that certified organic farms involved in production for export were significantly more profitable than those involved in conventional production (in terms of net farm income earnings).136 Of these cases, 87 per cent showed increases in farmer and household incomes as a result of becoming organic, which contributed to reducing poverty levels and to increasing regional food security.
The transgenes used in creating GM crops are patented and owned by biotech companies. In the United States and Canada, companies have launched lawsuits against farmers whose crops were alleged to contain a company’s patented GM genes. Farmers’ claims that they have not intentionally planted GM crops have proved no defense in court against large fines being imposed.
In contrast, low-input and organic farming methods do not involve patented technologies. Control of food production remains in the hands of farmers, keeping farmer skills alive and favoring food security.
GM crop technologies do not offer significant benefits. On the contrary, they present risks to human and animal health, the environment, farmers, food security, and export markets. There is no convincing reason to take such risks with the livelihoods of farmers when proven successful and widely acceptable alternatives are readily and cheaply available. These alternatives will maintain the independence of the food supply from foreign multinational control and offer the best insurance against the challenges of climate change.

Among Tennessee cities, Chattanooga has always been overshadowed by its bigger brothers, Nashville and Memphis. It’s smaller, rough around the edges, and, of course, lacks the same music industry cachét as its siblings. It also didn’t help that the EPA once dubbed it “the dirtiest city in America” — a place where the air was so thick with pollutants that residents had to drive with their headlights on during the day just to see. It took decades for the city to shake that charming moniker.
Fast-forward to today and Chattanooga has quietly come into its own as a hip, progressive, ultra-green destination. For adventure-lovers in particular, it’s an ideal home base with access to some of the country’s best hiking, biking, paddling, and more. The town also boasts an easily walkable, bustling downtown core full of gastropubs, craft beer bars, year-round concerts and events, and direct access to the Tennessee River. Whether you’re planning to relocate or just spend a weekend in Chattanooga, Tennessee, here are our favorite places to eat, play, and stay.
Eastern Tennessee is home to some of the best outdoor adventure opportunities in the country. There are more than 120 miles of single-track mountain biking within 10 miles of downtown. The rugged sandstone cliffs that dot the surrounding landscape have provided climbers with an endless variety of routes for at least three decades. The nearby Ocoee River offers extreme whitewater rafting, while the Tennessee River (which winds through the city) hosts calmer water-based pursuits like kayaking and paddle boarding. The city even hosts annual Ironman and half-Ironman triathlon events. Suffice to say, there’s no shortage of adventurous things to do in and around Chattanooga.
Chattanooga has long been a favorite spot for rock climbers and lovers of bouldering. The sandstone hills, mountains, and valleys that surround the city provide endless opportunities. Climbers can frequently be found scaling the rock faces that line the downtown portion of the Tennessee River. High Point Climbing and Fitness is also home to 30,000 square feet of climbing space, making it one of the largest urban rock walls in the country. The towering, four-story structure gives visitors the opportunity to climb indoors or scale the exterior wall, which offers excellent downtown views.
For Those Looking to Get Higher.
Tennessee didn’t invent hang-gliding, but it did popularize the sport in the modern form that we know today. Less than 45 minutes from downtown, Lookout Mountain Flight Park is the country’s premier hang-gliding school. First-timers can hop on a 20-minute, introductory tandem flight with a certified instructor. Even those without experience will have the opportunity to pilot their craft for a few climbs and dives. For those looking to jump head-first into the sport, the park also offers full Federal Aviation Administration certification.
Ruby Falls is one of, if not the most, hyped tourist attraction in Chattanooga. On paper, it sounds amazing — a stunning, 150-foot waterfall hidden 1,120 feet underground at the end of a web of tunnels and caverns. Don’t fall for the trap. To be sure, it’s a sight to behold. But there’s a reason many local ‘Noogans never bother to see it for themselves. It’s crowded and expensive, and visitors are allowed only a few brief minutes at the falls before being ushered back the way they came on a too-long tour.
The Chattanoogan food and beverage scene has exploded in recent years. While it may lack the same breadth of much larger cities (the downtown core stretches for only about 16 blocks), the restaurants and bars in that tiny space are crushing it. Urban Stack Burger Lounge offers the city’s best “killer burgers and manly drinks” in the vintage-cool, 150-year-old Southern Railway Baggage Building. The outside patio is a chill spot to sip an Old Fashioned and enjoy a Big Mike burger with two all-beef patties and three buns.
To round out a late night of boozing in the city, make your last stop the Pickle Barrel. Situated in an iconic flatiron building, it’s one of the city’s diviest dive bars, wildly popular with college kids and anyone with more beer money than sense. Grab a dirt-cheap draft and a basket of the famous fried pickles and head to the tiny rooftop deck for great people-watching.
Downtown Chattanooga’s leisure travel infrastructure is, in many ways, still in its infancy. The good news is that visitors won’t need to fight the thick crowds of tourists found in other, more popular vacation destinations. The downside is that the number of boutique accommodations is limited. Airbnb is a solid, inexpensive bet, and there are hundreds of convenient options in and around the city center.
Chattanooga experiences four distinct seasons, but not in the same extreme way that, say, New England does. Fall is, no doubt, the best time to go. The sticky heat of the summer cools off and daily highs in the 80s feel more manageable. Plus, the leaves begin to turn and the throngs of fellow visitors thin out. Autumn is often the least crowded, prettiest, and cheapest time to visit.
Chattanooga’s location on the banks of the Tennessee River is ideal for year-round events, including concerts, races, and art shows. Here are the best happenings:.
April: The 4 Bridges Arts Festival is the city’s largest fine art-centric event with more than 50,000 square feet of pavilion space. For almost twenty years, the show has brought world-class artwork in an array of mediums to Chattanooga. A total of $15,000 in award money is given out, and attendees are welcome to purchase their favorite works. There is, of course, plenty of live music, food, and adult beverages.
May: The city’s craft beer history has exploded in recent years. The annual, one-day Chattabrewga is dedicated to special releases and rare brews from across the country. Tickets include access to unlimited samplings, food, and live music.
June: Spread across a good chunk of the Tennessee River, Riverbend Festival is the closest thing Chattanooga has to a local Woodstock. The lineup changes each year, but 2017 featured almost 100 artists across five stages with eight days of performances. For more than three decades, it has drawn some of the biggest musicians, such as Boz Scaggs, Ludacris, George Thorogood, and Toby Keith. There are plenty of vendors, food tastings, and beer throughout the event, which culminates in a fireworks finale on the last day. The roughly $40 ticket is a bargain since it includes admission to every performance for the entire week-long event.

A TRUSTED golf club bookkeeper who stole £43,000 has been ordered to pay back her ill-gotten gains.
And the 57-year-old has appeared again before a judge for a confiscation order under the proceeds of crime act.
The court was told the realisable assets were £29,156.26, which she was ordered to pay back by Judge Michael Cartlidge within six months.
Vice President George Ryder said: “She has not stolen from the club but from each member and that is the thing to stress.
“Many of them regarded Sue as a personal friend.
“The reaction was one of absolute shock when all of this began to come out. It was a serious breach of trust over a prolonged period of time.”.
“In any small business losing £43,000 would have an adverse effect,” he said.
“It has been a severe blow to our development plans.”.
Cameron began her role at the club almost six years ago after taking early retirement from Barclays Bank.
She already had a mountain of credit card debt, the court heard.
And after working without fault for more than two years, Cameron began helping herself to club cash on a monthly basis.
But she told police cash had also gone on living expenses and a holiday, the court heard.
Jailing her last year, Recorder Andrew Haslam said: “You knew this offence was committed against a backdrop of you being trusted to look after that money and you stole it on a monthly basis for some two-and-a-half years.
“I have been invited on your behalf to suspend the sentence of imprisonment that must be inevitable for an offence as serious as this but I’m afraid I am not able to do that.”.
Gavin Doig, mitigating, said Cameron had already been punished by losing her good name and was now likely to lose her home under a Proceeds of Crime Inquiry. “We have all been able to see and hear in court the shame and remorse she feels,” Mr Doig said.

Ethyl Corporation takes a very proactive approach toward characterizing and managing risks associated with the company’s products. This process consists of the following steps as illustrated by this flow schematic, and explained below:.
The hazard classification for all our products is published on the MSDSs which are supplied to all customers irrespective of whether or not the product is classified as hazardous.
Based on this process, we assign appropriate exposure ratings for our products.
Once a product is characterized, a specific risk management strategy for the product is developed commensurate with that risk.
Re-evaluation of a product’s risk characterization and management could be done in a number of scenarios:.
• Availability of new information through research, analytical or other sources.

We will provide the best medical service from the patient’s point of view.
We seek to respect human rights, protect privacy, and comply with laws and regulations.
We strive for daily education, in order to become more trustworthy medical personnel.
We aim to be a safe and secure new hospital that is loved and trusted by the community.
We will conduct sound management in order to continually realize the above six goals.

This is the real power of DNA: the topic of whether central European farmers were the result of demic diffusion from the southeast or indigenous hunter-gatherers who adopted the agricultural economy has been endlessly debated in archaeological circles.
We are finally in a position to give an answer to the question, and the answer is in favor of the diffusionist camp and against the idea of acculturation by local hunter-gatherers. Surprisingly, modern Central Europeans do not appear to be a simple hunter-gatherer/farmer mix, suggesting that even later events (post-Neolithic) have shaped their genetic diversity.
The finding is based on analysis of genetic material in the skeletal remains of ancient hunter-gatherers and early farmers found in Germany, Lithuania, Poland, and Russia—though farming is thought to have reached areas as far west as western France during the period of rapid expansion, about 7,500 years ago.
The study goes against a long-standing idea that Europe's first farmers were former hunter-gatherer populations that had settled the region after the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago.
Perhaps, the thinking went, the hunter-gatherers had observed farming practices during their travels or had learned from neighbors.
Instead, the researchers found, the hunter-gatherers and the early farmers remained segregated, according to the study, to be published tomorrow in the journal Science.
For more than a century archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists, and more recently, geneticists, have argued about who the ancestors of Europeans living today were. We know that people lived in Europe before and after the last big ice age and managed to survive by hunting and gathering. We also know that farming spread into Europe from the Near East over the last 9,000 years, thereby increasing the amount of food that can be produced by as much as 100-fold. But the extent to which modern Europeans are descended from either of those two groups has eluded scientists despite many attempts to answer this question.
"Our analysis shows that there is no direct continuity between hunter-gatherers and farmers in Central Europe," says Prof Joachim Burger. "As the hunter-gatherers were there first, the farmers must have immigrated into the area.".
The study identifies the Carpathian Basin as the origin for early Central European farmers. "It seems that farmers of the Linearbandkeramik culture immigrated from what is modern day Hungary around 7,500 years ago into Central Europe, initially without mixing with local hunter gatherers," says Barbara Bramanti, first author of the study. "This is surprising, because there were cultural contacts between the locals and the immigrants, but, it appears, no genetic exchange of women.".
The new study confirms what Joachim Burger´s team showed in 2005; that the first farmers were not the direct ancestors of modern European. Burger says "We are still searching for those remaining components of modern European ancestry. European hunter-gatherers and early farmers alone are not enough. But new ancient DNA data from later periods in European prehistory may shed also light on this in the future.".
A new study published by Barbara Bramanti and colleagues in Science Express on September 4, 2009, supports what some scholars have suspected all along—that the LBK likely were an in-migration of people from the Balkans, and that they did not, initially anyway, do much mixing at all with the earlier inhabitants of Europe.
In the Skipping Stone model, farmers move out in search of new territories before they have started to blend with the local foragers; the genetic impact of the initiators of the movement is preserved.
What we do know is this: first farmers were not local foragers who abandoned the old ways for the new ones. Amalgamation between farmer and forager did not happen quickly as the farming economy spread. Finally it did happen, of course, and either because (i) there were few foragers in the mix, or (ii) their mtDNA was selected against, modern central Europeans have very little mitochondrial descent from the earliest European populations.
MtDNA is fickle and any conclusions must be taken with a grain of salt. Even today, I could show you small regions within Europe with predominantly a single MtDNA sub-sub-group. That's just how local regions and their inhabitants work...
Clearly, there is nothing spectacular about the results. The farmer's MtDNA is largely of the same type that is widely spread within Europe, today (50% H, 11% J, 10% T, sizable K and T).
Similarly, the observed "hunter-gatherer" MtDNA - as expected - only provides a restricted snapshot of the known distributions - which are all not only old, but still make up 11% (U5) and 10% (T) of modern Europeans.
Even today, I could show you small regions within Europe with predominantly a single MtDNA sub-sub-group. That's just how local regions and their inhabitants work...
So, yes, the evidence for haplogroup U in pre-Neolithic populations is probably as good as it can get.
but still make up 11% (U5) and 10% (T) of modern Europeans.
"We are cautious of interpreting this as a signature of.
local admixture (17), particularly as the hunter-gatherer and.
to 5-7% in most core European areas, and rising to 10-20% in.
You know very well that arguing a few percentages over seven millennia is futile.
You have to look at the origin and major inhabited regions and opportunities for huge multiplication of local groups.
An ~8-fold reduction in the frequency of the haplogroups prevalent in hunter-gatherers is not "a few percentages". The modern frequencies are well known and the ancient ones are reasonably estimated from a pre-Neolithic sample that is varied both geographically and temporally.
I can’t remember details, but a while ago I read an article on Neolithic violence and tensions between farming communities and hunter-gatherers in Central Europe. Documented by individuals that showed signs of force that lead to death.
What I mean is that the ancient hunter-gatherer MtDNA has survived quite well - both the observed one (which excludes smaller percentage haplogroups because of the small sample size), and the inferred one (much of today's MtDNA in Europe is thought to be ancient European, present at least during post-LGM expansion, and likely 10,000 or more years before then). Sure, U* was reduced from 80% or something to 15% - 20%, those things happen, and it apparently was not farmer MtDNA that makes up for the difference, but mostly other old European MtDNA.
For those reasons, what we can't deduce is this:.
What we do know is this: first farmers were not local foragers who abandoned the old ways for the new ones.
"Shepherds were much more likely to be Hunter-Gatherers than were the farmers".
This study does constitute pretty good evidence in favor of a population expansion instead of cultural transmission, but it hasn't settled the matter. Dienekes talks about an 8-fold reduction in U frequency, but there's a similar problem with the farmer mtdna. Their main haplogroup, N1a, has suffered a 25-fold reduction. And today the rate of H in Europe is 50%, while the study found it at only 16% in the farmers, so that's another big change, a 3-fold increase.
And also K has been halved, but farmer had multiplaied it for 4. But we are always playing at home.
The farming communities may have been violent. Where in the world now is violence not found? Some cases of people who had their heads bashed in, in Neolithic times do not make it the rule for all those previous inhabitants of Europe. In Malta there were no weapons found archeologically until after the coming of Bronze Age people and there are signs there that the island was inhabited by Neolithic peoples 7 Kya. Oetzi, the Alpine Iron Age man, himself died of the results of an arrow wound.
If we had found L, M or D in ancient Europeans, we could think that there is no flow, but founding H, U, K, etc., sometimes of a different line than today, we can think that we are always playing at home. Probably modern haplogroups continue some haplogroups that were rare and that have survived, and other then more diffused are extinct, but certainly we are the descendants of those Europeans.
K 224c/311c is mine, and probably K 224c/258g/311c has become extinct or has had a back mutation, what does it matter? We are always playing at home.
Not only. Perhaps the same process was involved in the replacement of Neanderthals.
Pre-Columbian North America may be another good example. Farmers and hunter-gatherers lived side-by-side; sometimes peacefully, sometimes not. AFAIK there is no documentation that either group was above-average, particularly violent before the Europeans made them battle each other.
What may be important is that even during the LBK "Blitz," things would have appeared somewhat slow on a generational time frame. The hunter-gatherers saw a couple more settlements in their region during their lifetime, of people who seemed to compete little for the wild life, but brought with them the opportunity to barter (say, grains, ceramic vessels, string/rope, clothing, hand-crafted vanity items vs. stones, axes, furs, collected berries and nuts, other, different hand-crafted vanity items on the other side, and also brought with them exotic, pretty women.
On the flip side, the MtDNA seems to support theories that claim early farmers were (at least partially) matriarchal, with farming women very protective of their farming knowledge, rights, standing, and their being the sole source of children.
It may have been a strong taboo for a farmer's boy to bring home a "dirty, poor, uneducated tom-boy girl from the forest." If they eloped, her MtDNA would have remained with the hunter-gatherers.
Also, at least during the first several generations of expansion, it is likely that the hunter-gatherers would have had the better weapons and better training/use of weapons. I don't see (initially) the aggressive spread of y-DNA that Europeans later documented throughout the world, and the related rapid inclusion of "native" MtDNA from multiple "illegitimate" children of mistresses. The farmers would not have been dominant like that, until they far outnumbered the hunter-gatherers (500 to 2,000 years later, depending on location).
I am not convinced by the conclusions of this paper. Wolfgang Haaks paper shows Haplogroup U, H and K living together in the same high density community in Germany during the late neolithic (4000-5000 years). H was in the minority.
We know that mobile hunter gathers had spaced children to cope with the lifestyle. A child had to be old enough to survive before the mother could have another child.
We also know that the early sedentary farmers had no such constraints and bred like rabbits.
It has been suggested that there is a genetic and/or dietary component to this difference.
One possible explanation for the high percentage of Haplogroup H in Europe is that this Haplogroup is simply better able to expand rapidly when the opportunity arises.

Just a hypothetical question. How absolutely bad would a BMW E28 M5 have to be to pass up a chance to buy one in the $8k range?
For me, rust is the deal breaker on a car. Once it starts, it seems to be in lots of places, many of which are not easily spotted and it never sleeps.
Engine . . . I think that's a pretty exotic engine, can't be cheap to rebuild.
It would probably be a lot cheaper to buy a nice one. Unless a car is mega-valuable, (like certain early 911s and 356s), the math never works out for a restoration.
This is coming from someone who has done a bit of restoring and will do some more. You have to choose your projects very carefully or you can wind up dead w a half-finished car in your barn.
Lol, yes it is. However small chance the engine is salvageable.
Put some $$ aside for electrics and rust, if still within the budget ...do it! You'll love it.
I knew it would happen, just not so soon...........
Yes! I actually had an ‘87 635csi and I still have an 88 535is along with an e28 parts car. To be honest, I prefer the e28 as far as drivability is concerned. With e28 M5 values rapidly approaching e30 M3 money I can’t really see how I can go wrong here. I guess the ‘74 911 project is going to be on the back burner for a while longer.
Rust or not if you can make it run it would be a fun daily driver. I have a 1987 535i for a toy but a m5 would be more fun.
e28s in general and M5s in particular have seen a pretty dramatic upswing in value over the last couple of years.
I bought my M5 10 years ago when prices were still 'reasonable' and I wouldn't take less than $50k today.
That's an absolutely bananas price for that 535i. I don't care how clean it is.

PORT ORCHARD — A 22-year-old Bremerton man who pleaded guilty to raping an intoxicated woman he drove home from a bar was sentenced Monday to five years in prison.
While he was being investigated for that sexual assault, he was charged with second-degree rape for sexually assaulting another woman after a passerby reported a violent assault in the parking lot at Linder Field off Silverdale Way.
The woman told a Kitsap County Sheriff’s Office investigator that she forced him off of her, left the room and came back into the room and confronted Hulett. He introduced himself, shook her hand and explained that he had driven her car and brought her to his house, according to documents.
When interviewed by an investigator, Hulett denied having sex with the woman. Investigators wrote they found the woman’s bra during a search of his room.
The woman told a state Department of Corrections interviewer that she was satisfied with the five-year sentence and that she was in treatment.
Hulett told the interviewer he was innocent, that he had tried to explain his side to no avail and that he took the plea deal to avoid a potentially longer sentence if he was convicted at trial.
When he is released from prison, Hulett will be required to register as a sex offender.

Subject: Tell the world about yourself! Fri Sep 04, 2009 9:51 pm.
I'll be posting mine soon enough, I just wanted to give you all a chance to start.
I stole this CS from Hiratsu, who stole it from someone else. The link to the original is at the bottom.
2. Make sure any information that could be used to identify you is altered slightly, for security reasons. I am not responsible for anyone being stalked because they gave someone their real uncle's name.
3. Either PM it to the handful of people you want to let know more about you, or post it here for us all!
4. If it's too long for one post, divide it into a few. I don't mind and I think the mods will be okay with it... I'll ask them soon.
5. Suggest new questions to put into the survey so that others can find out even more about the people they hang out with online!
6. Be honest, both with us and with yourself. This is so that people will know the real you, to some degree. You don't have to fill it ALL out, but I'll have a moderator delete your post if I catch someone lying. If you don't like the answer you'd have to give, leave it blank.
7. Enjoy yourself! This is letting other people in on who you are. If they can't accept who you are, that's their problem. This is something that few nerds/geeks/webcrawlers ever actually get to do. Real people will know the real you! *Is very socially deprived, and will mention that in his survey*.
8. Come back every now and then to update your old CS. Sometimes things change, and we want to hear about it! Besides, the survey will probably get longer so you'll be missing out on new stuff if you don't check back.

3. Describe your posture. Do you carry yourself well or do you slouch? I walk around watching the ground, because the sun hurts my eyes and I really don’t like making eye contact anyways.
4. How is your health? Are you fit or out of shape? Any illnesses or conditions? Any physical disabilities? I’m easily exhausted, but other than my heart lagging behind I’m quite healthy. I don’t get sick often, usually not for very long either.
6. How attractive are you physically? How do you perceive yourself in the mirror? I’m alright. I’ve been told I’m cute, or handsome, but I really don’t see it. I have fairly low confidence in my looks, mostly because I consider looks entirely irrelevant. It simply doesn’t make sense that people would care if my hair is brushed.
7. Describe your complexion. Dark, light, clear, scarred? I heal very quickly, so the only scars I have are some bug bites on my legs that I picked at repeatedly and stretch marks from gaining 30+ pounds in three months. (No exercise, grilled cheese and chocolate icecream every day.) All of them are fading fast, and I expect them to be gone in two years tops. The bites may be replaced by new bite-scars though. I’m not very tan, but I’m no longer a complete ghost. I have the genes for darker complexion, but I don’t get any real time in the sun so they just keep me from being pasty-white. Not many freckles.
9. What color are your eyes? Green, but in the shadow they look brown. I keep to the shadow most of the time, so you can just call it brown.
10. Do you have any other noteworthy features? A mole on my eyelid that most people notice after a year or two. A tendency to zits sometimes, but I pop them quickly and they heal in a day, so they never stay for more than 48 hours unless they just won’t mature. Those I handle with medicine now, so it happens far less often.
11. What are your chief tension centers? Upper back, lower back, head, muscles, bones, organs, connective tissue, you name it. I’ve probably had tension stored everywhere you can think of.
12. What is your wardrobe like? Casual, dressy, utilitarian? Bright colors, pastels, neutrals? Is it varied, or do you have six of the same suit? Utilitarian. Very. I can buy a whole rack of $5 Walmart tees and $7 blue jeans and not be bothered in the least. I usually have a decent variety of colors for the same basic shirt, and 6 pairs of the same jeans at any given moment.
13. Do your clothes fit well? Do you feel and look comfortable in them? Well, they aren’t tailored to me but I’m fairly common build. Most of them work pretty well, save for the older jeans that I bought when I weighed 185.
14. Does you dress the same on the job as you does in your free time? If not, what are the differences? I wear scrubs to work. Usually light blue, light green, or brown. Scratch usually, that’s all I’ve got.
1. What does your voice sound like? High-pitched, deep, hoarse? Middle of the road, nothing special about my usual voice. I’m a shade lower than Brad Pitt.
2. How do you normally speak? Loud, soft, fast, evenly? Do you talk easily, or do you hesitate? Soft, often ignored entirely. I wait forever for a gap in the conversation to say my peace. I try to keep an even, understandable pace. Sometimes I keep speaking just a little bit after I run out of air, trying to finish a sentence before drawing another breath.
3. Do you have a distinct accent or dialect? Any individual quirks of pronunciation? Any, like, you know, verbal tics? I have no accent that I know of. (I certainly don‘t sound Texan…) I do have a tendency to use a wide vocabulary, which has long resulted in confusion between me and the average teenager.
4. What language/s do you speak, and with how much fluency? I speak English very fluently and with a wide vocabulary. I speak VERY minimal Spanish, and know phrases of several other languages. I know the sentence structure of Japanese to a lesser extent, but not enough phrases to consider it even basic knowledge.
1. How intelligent are you? Are you book-smart or street-smart? I’m capable of learning very quickly about anything that interests me. I can mix knowledge in useful ways to see things that aren’t apparent to others. If I’m not interested, I discard the information altogether, regardless of whether I actually needed to know it or not. This makes for great brains, and poor grades.
6. Are you an introvert or an extrovert? Introvert. Very, very introvert. Large crowds annoy me, I’ll go out of my way not to like anything popular, and I don’t socialize at all.
7. Describe your temperament. Are you even-tempered or do you have mood swings? Cheerful or melancholy? Laid-back or driven? I started out the most level-headed hostility sponge anyone could imagine. Lately, I became very much short fused until I left public school for the safety of others and the sanity of my parents. More recently I’ve cooled back down, and am no longer capable of picking up a sword and marching off to school. Yes, I said sword. Guns run out of bullets, my katana would have kept going and going and going… But I’m past that now.
8. How do you respond to new people or situations? Are you suspicious, relaxed, timid, enthusiastic? Suspicious, hanging at the outskirts and trying to keep an advantageous position for a fight with an exit nearby but not behind me where I can’t see people come in.
9. Are you more likely to act, or to react? I act by forcing others to act. Then I react. I control the situation, deciding when someone’s going to finally take a shot, then using that timing against them.
12. Do you have any diagnosable mental disorders? If yes, how do you deal with them? I have undiagnosed Aspergers. It’s a social disorder that means I’ll never see the world quite the same as most people. It’s generally accompanied by a lack of friends, a naïve personality, unusually strong obsessions, and a high IQ.
14. What do you fear? Honestly? Nothing anymore, on some levels. I can force myself past anything using a certain bit of information I’ve found. But on the other hand, the thing that would hurt me the most is if someone hurt her… Even with my knowledge I will never stop worrying about that possibility.
15. What are your hopes or aspirations? I could care less. I don’t need much and I’d like to see us develop the ability to store human minds in computers to revive later during my lifetime. Other than that I’ll pretty much take what I get.
16. What is something you don't want a family member or a friend to find out about you? My family may be reading this, so it would be rather impractical to write that here. Sorry.
Part 2. It was too long for one post.
1. Describe your relationship with your parents. Good, though there’s isn’t great with each other. I pretty much stay out of the way and help at work. We don’t talk that much because there isn’t much to be said.
2. Do you have any siblings? What is/was that relationship like? My brother. I’d take a bullet for him just to strangle him myself.
4. Are there other, unrelated people whom you consider part of your family? What are your relationships with them? My friends are family. There is no distinction there.
5. Who is/was your best friend? How did you meet? She’s the nutcase I’ll be stuck with as cellmate when we both get shoved into the padded white rooms. At school, another close friend introduced us near the start of the year back in… 6th grade? 7th?. It started off kind of rocky, but within weeks we were close. Since then, things have gotten far apart and then close together again a few times, but she’s still there no matter what.
6. Do you have other close friends? Yep. Several. The big guy is into anime and has lots of southern pride stuff - misprints and poor word choices that make them look like total goons. It’s hilarious when you see his ‘The Souh Will Rise Again’(sic) flag up on the wall. The shorter, slightly puffy but working it off guy is also gay as a two dollar bill. He’s got great taste though, and he’s an incredible sniper with awards so don’t piss him off.
I’ve got others, but those are the three I’d cross an ocean to die for.
8. Which do you consider more important: family or friends? Friends are family. No distinction.
9. Are you single, married, divorced, widowed? Have you been married more than once? Single.
10. Are you currently in a romantic relationship with someone other than a spouse? No. Kind of flirting, but nothing that’ll lead anywhere if we’re sane and rational.
The latest my best friend, but that’s not going anywhere because I know I’ll never be able to give her the life she deserves. So I’m more or less just single and flirty at the moment, because nothing else is going to do more than get me in too deep before I remember I can’t actually live a normal life.
12. What do you look for in a romantic partner? The ability to spend the rest of our lives together - and never regret one damned minute of the time we spent laughing together.
13. Do you have children? Grandchildren? If yes, how do you relate to them? If no, do you want any? Nope, and nope. I can put up with kids, but I’m not a father figure.
14. Do you have any rivals or enemies? Everyone who isn’t a friend more or less hates me. XD.
16. How do you feel about sex? How important is it to you? I can do just fine without another person. Still, I like seeing other people happy, so it’s more about them than me anyways.
17. What are your turn-ons? Turn-offs? Weird bedroom habits? I don’t like excessive body altering, or girls who come on too strong. If they act like they’re dying to get into your pants, you’re probably not the first person they’ve jumped without really knowing. I’d like to keep my bits from falling off, thanks. No real turn-ons.
1. Do you know your astrological (zodiac sign? How well do you fit the type? I don’t really study it.
2. Are you religious, spiritual, both, or neither? How important are these elements in your life? I’ll decline for personal reasons.
3. Do you have a personal code of morals or ethics? If so, how did that begin? What would it take to compromise it? I’ll protect my family, friends included, above and before all else. Nothing else matters. Nothing will ever compromise that.
4. How do you regard beliefs that differ from your? Are you tolerant, intolerant, curious, indifferent? I’m tolerant of tolerant people. People who aren’t tolerant, should be tolerantly taught to be tolerant. By someone who has the tolerance not to beat them into a coma. That’s not me.
5. What prejudices do you hold? Did you come to these prejudices yourself? Did you inherit these prejudices from someone? I don’t hold prejudices against any group or organization. I do hold grudges very well, however. The difference is I’ll still be respectful of an asshole’s family, and won’t try to assume they are all like him/her.
1. What is your financial situation? Are you rich, poor, comfortable, in debt? Debt. Comfortable. It’s hard to explain… We owe money, but we’re still able to buy nice things. I suppose the best way to put it is that we aren’t very smart spenders.
2. What is your social status? Has this changed over time, and if so, how has the change affected you? My family is popular, I’m not. That hasn’t really changed, no matter where we move.
4. Besides the basic necessities, what do you spend your money on? Books and electronics. Always.
6. What are your interests or hobbies? How do you spend your free time? Books, electronics, studying things that most people can’t understand and using them to fashion new ideas for cool items I can’t afford to make but would be able to sell for millions if I could prove they worked.
7. What are your eating habits? Do you skip meals, eat out, drink alcohol, avoid certain foods? No salad, no fish, no exceptions. Meat and potatoes kind of guy.
1. Color? I’m red. I like black. I don’t like yellow.
2. Smell? I’m Axe Phoenix. I like Axe Phoenix. I don’t like trash left in the rain for a week.
3. Time of day? I’m probably dusk. I like the night, when the moon is full. I don’t like the sun, so noon is killer.
4. Season? I’m probably fall. I like summer. I don’t like winter, except when it’s actually snowy.
5. Book? I’m a science fiction. I like fiction and sci fi. I don’t like biographies.
6. Music? I’m a techno, or an anime theme song. I like random songs from random genres, but usually not anything remotely popular. I don’t like most popular songs, or country.
9. Plant? I’m not really a plant kind of guy. Some plants are cool, but not cool enough for me to bother remembering the names of which ones.
10. Animal? I don’t really associate myself with any animals. I like sugar gliders, various mythical creatures, and many others. I don’t like anything smelly or large that isn’t outright deadly.
I don’t know what other people view me as for any of these, so I’m leaving that part out.
Try to remember, this is the real me. This is as deep as I could dig for honest answers. Poke fun at me and I'll hunt you down.

Good to meet you, Mike. *Checks another name off the list* At this rate, I'll have the whole site in by next month! This is really cool, and I'm glad everyone is putting forth the effort. Has anyone learned anything they really didn't expect? Anyone thought of anything they want added to the survey? Any confusing wording I need to change?
Depends on how proud or relaxed I'm feeling- usually do my best to walk straight.
I'm a dork, get with the program.
There's plenty to work on but everyone thinks they're flawed.
Comfortable and things I can relax in after a hard day of work or a few hours of martial arts. Oh, board shorts, lots of board shorts.
It's a normal voice that's ot really high pitched or deep.
I'm not very well spoken I guess but that's the least of my worries.
Probably more book smart in the sense that I can help you with your homework. Don't get me wrong, I'm street smart- I stay off the streets.
I've learned to think things through a little more.
I'm doing a Graphic Design course so I'm still a student.
Music and art are my main areas- I live those things.
I'm laid back until the switch is flicked. Then we all worry about my anger.
I have a good range of sense of humour. But I also know where to cut the line.
I'm cautious of most things without fearing them. However- how I die is an issue to me. You can shoot me, stab me, snap my neck- whatever, just no drowning or burning.
To be happy, earn the money I need to not worry about how I live and to be there for my friends.
Just because I don't mention things doesn't mean I don't want them found out. Give it time and the right questions.
Dad, love. Mum, rocky road. I love her yes, but she tests me.
Family friends, those people you adopt as your family because they're so good to you.
Tegan, she can read me like a book and has known me since high school.
Mark, haha, he lived across the road from me when we were kids. And latest... eh..
Well grounded, easy going, neat to talk to and ofcourse they've gotta make you happy.
Tried both sides, haven't really liked either. Men and women are as bad as eachother. Therefore I choose to like neither right now.
I'm not greatly religious. God may exist but lets not get into a debate now.
Do'nt we all have the moral code were were raised in?
To prejudge would make me a horrible person.
I'm in work so, I'm getting by.
I got my friends and they got me- we have a good time what else could you want.
My living will be Graphics. I'm good at that. I'm also good at fighting though so, if all else fails...
I chill out when I'm not at work or martial arts. See my mates too- watch a movie or several.
I eat alot, don't drink a great deal of alcohol, and avoid anything that smells funny or stares back at me.
1. Color? Orange, it's so full of warmth.

2. Do you have any siblings? What is/was that relationship like? : I have one sister who's 19. And I honestly thought I was going to hate her for eternity. However, we've actually grown incredibly close this past year, and she's come to be one of my best friends.

1. Color? Out of the primaries and secondaries? Green, blue and yellow.
5. Book? that's like asking a mother to choose her favorite child!
I'm at about 5'11, which is the average height in my family, and heavyset.
2. How old are you? Twenty-three. Will be twenty-four in November.
Hmm. More of a fluid motion. I'm not clumsy or tense. I'm probably one of the most relaxed people you'll ever met.
Slightly dark, not a great deal though. Native American blood in me. And I have several small scars over my arms and fingers as well as along the legs.
Casual with a hint of dressy, but not a lot. Most of them are dark colors blacks and blues.
That's priorty number 1 in my book is that they feel comfortable.
Soft and/or evenly. And I talk easily.
I have a bit of the southern accent and dialect. And yes, the redneck quirks of pronounciation come in there at times too.
Sometimes if I'm trying to make someone laugh.
I have trouble pronouncing some words sometimes, but otherwise, I can speak pretty eloquent or the like most of the time.
A bit of both. And as for how intelligent I am, I'm average or so, in my opinion.
3. Describe your thought process. Are you more logical, or more intuitive? Idealistic or practical? Hmm.. Its a tough one actually. I'd say I'm more intuitive and more idealistic with a hint of practicality.
5. What are your areas of expertise? What, if anything, are you interested in learning more about? Writing and transcription. Anything and everything. I love to learn things.
A mixture really. Its according to what situation you get me in. But I'd lean more towards introvert.
8. How do you respond to new people or situations? Are you suspicious, relaxed, timid, enthusiastic? Relaxed. I like meeting new people.
Fight. Fighting doesn't always mean the physical and if it gets to that point, I won't back down either. I find fighting pointless for the most part, unless the cause is accurate.
Love jokes and teasing/sarcastic humour. But like someone said above me, don't make fun of someone else if you can't make fun of yourself.
My hopes, dreams, and aspirations are to become a successful teacher. To help young people find that place in the world where they can make the different. To become a well known author around the world. To love the woman of my dreams until I'm old and gray.
That I'm insecure about myself a lot of the times. That my problems, I always keep to myself, unless someone comes to me openly. I'm very stubborn and I don't like people knowing when something is wrong with me.
With my mom, I have the best relationship in the world. With my dad, we are close, but not as much as we should be.
Two half-brothers, one step brother. And we are all very, very close.
4. Are there other, unrelated people whom you consider part of your family? What are your relationships with them? Just some of my friends, namely one or two.
Oh yeah. Quite a few.. Well not that many, but about 4 or 5.
Both. I couldn't put a line between them like that.
Someone from preschool. And latest, well, they know who they are.
Someone who can accept me for whom I am and my crazy spouts. Someone who knows just how big my heart actually is inside. Someone who would just stand beside me and love me. They have to be smart, caring, and loving.
13. Do you have children? Grandchildren? If yes, how do you relate to them? If no, do you want any? None.
Nope. I don't believe in enemies.
It’s a good thing, as long as its in a commited relationship. And important? Not really. I don't have to have it to make me love someone.
2. Is your religious, spiritual, both, or neither? How important are these elements in your life? Spiritual and with prayer. I've started to come into this a lot more here lately.
Yes, I do. It began shortly after high school honestly, which is all in all 5 years ago. And to compromise it? A lot.
I'm understanding. People believe what they believe because that's what it is. We shouldn't try to down someone for what they believe in, but accept it. It just makes us who we are.
I used to be. But now, none. I don't believe in it anymore. People shouldn't be judged for what they are, but for whom they are on the inside. A prejudice is a crutch.
A little bit in debt, but I have a steady job which is paying the bills. I'm hoping for a big change soon though.
Hmm.. I'm a bit shy but also outgoing at the same time. I'm not as bad as I used to be. I was known for being the quite one in school, even got an award for it. And the change.. Its really helped, I've met a lot of new people here and there when the opportunity presents itself. I'm not afraid of saying what is on my mind either.
House. Just a place to crash, honestly. And in good condition, still needs some work. And yes. My mother and step dad as well as with a pupper dawg.
Well, used to be games and books, magazines, and a few little odds and ends there with some exercise equipment. But now, nothing. I'm getting myself out of my debt so I can achieve something great.
I work as a transcriptionist at a hospital. I'm okay at it, not the best, I suppose, but I get the job done. Not much anymore, I don't, no. Million other places I'd rather be.
I eat what I like. I don't like to skip meals as its worse for you than overeating. Alcohol I avoid now. I'm not a too big of a vegetable eater either.
2. Smell? Honeysuckle. Can't get enough of that stuff.
4. Season? Fall, Winter, and Spring.
8. Substance? Water. Give me a good lake any day of the week and I could be content for life.
9. Plant? Honeysuckle. As you can see, I can't get enough of that stuff.
10. Animal? Falcon. Oh what it would be like to soar in the sky.
1. Describe the your height and build. Are you heavyset, thin, short, rangy? I've come full circle, reaching up to 170 in muscle, and cycling back down to 150 string-man again. Ultimately, I'm in almost the same shape I was back then.
3. Describe your posture. Do you carry yourself well or do you slouch? The slouch is not gone, but it is much lighter. I walk a little taller, though not much. The sun still hurts my eyes, but I try not to stare at the ground as often.
4. How is your health? Are you fit or out of shape? Any illnesses or conditions? Any physical disabilities? About the same as last time, I don't get really sick but a few times a year if that, heal quickly from EVERYTHING, and am in decent enough shape as to not be concerned. Though I'd like to be stronger and have better endurance.
5. How do you move? Are you clumsy, graceful, tense, fluid? No more hands in my pocket full time (just when I'm uncomfortable or not paying attention) so I think I've made some progress in not looking so tense.
6. How attractive are you physically? How do you perceive yourself in the mirror? I'd say a bit more than then since I tend to look and act more confident. Physically the same, but it's more percievable now.
7. Describe your complexion. Dark, light, clear, scarred? Exactly like back then, I have clear skin with (just like I said it would be) no scars. Acne finally took a flying leap off a short pier into a volcano, I get maybe a zit a month now and they don't stay long.
8. Describe your hair: color, texture, style. We had an experiment in letting it get grow out, but it epic-failed. I have impossibly hard to manage hair, which is now (and hopefully forever) kept short where it's supposed to be.
9. What color are your eyes? You know, I still have to get up to check the mirror for this one? This morning, they are EXTREMELY green. Hell if I know why.
10. Do you have any other noteworthy features? My really big ____. Nah, joking aside I don't have anything I'd say stands out physically.
12. What is your wardrobe like? Casual, dressy, utilitarian? Bright colors, pastels, neutrals? Is it varied, or do you have six of the same suit? Much more varied, Ace keeps me in stuff that actual people wear. Jeans and t-shirts are still the day off norm, but they're better and more varied.
13. Do your clothes fit well? Do you feel and look comfortable in them? I suppose, I don't really pay much attention anymore.
14. Does you dress the same on the job as you does in your free time? If not, what are the differences? Slacks and polos, job requirement.
15. You knew it was coming: Boxers, briefs or commando? Whatever's (mostly) clean. Or nothing, if it gets to that point.
1. What does your voice sound like? High-pitched, deep, hoarse? I don't really pay attention to my voice, but I'd guess it hasn't changed much.
2. How do you normally speak? Loud, soft, fast, evenly? Do you talk easily, or do you hesitate? A bit louder, a bit more confident. I still get mostly ignored so I guess not much louder. Or maybe it's just that everyone knows I don't say anything important.
5. Do you switch languages or dialects in certain situations? When cashiering for someone who speaks Spanish, I try to speak it. Best way to learn. I still do voices, though not quite as often.
6. Are you a good impromptu speaker, or do you have to think about your words? Same as back then, I plan ahead as I'm talking. I still speak pretty clearly most of the time, but I still get flustered in a rush.
7. Are you eloquent or inarticulate? Under what circumstances might this change? Eloquent, unless I'm not thinking or thinking of more than one way to say something at once.
1. How intelligent are you? Are you book-smart or street-smart? Book smart, though I've learn a (very) little about street smarts from Ace.
2. Do you think on your feet, or do you need time to deliberate? I still think ahead of time and come mentally prepared for most situations, even ones that most people didn't see happening.
4. What kind of education have you had? Same, but I'm now very close to getting that elusive high school diploma.
5. What are your areas of expertise? What, if anything, are you interested in learning more about? I've learned more about customer service, I can now claim to be extremely good at defusing irritated people and politely telling theives to fuck off.
8. How do you respond to new people or situations? Are you suspicious, relaxed, timid, enthusiastic? I take things in stride, I still have that paranoid part of me that keeps tabs on environmental weapons, but I'm more relaxed in public than I used to be. You could say the trouble radar is still on but now not EVERYONE in the room is on it.
9. Are you more likely to act, or to react? React, I'm not as confrontational as I used to be.
10. Which is your default: fight or flight? I have to worry about two now, so I'd be more likely with most situations to get out of them. On the other hand, if it affects Ace, I'd happily make sure the problem would have trouble walking for a few weeks (years) [ever].
12. Do you have any diagnosable mental disorders? If yes, how do you deal with them? I've come to doubt the validity of my Asperger's, or at least the severity of it. I still fall in line with many of the traits but I've made so much progress towards being somewhat normal that it's hard to say I have anything physically wrong with my brain. Just takes some real training to get it sorted out.
15. What are your hopes or aspirations? I'm working on physical training and getting my diploma to enlist in the United States Airforce. I plan to take a roll in inventing and fine tuning the next generation of technology for the military. It hinges on a lot of ifs and shot in the darks, but that's the plan.
16. What is something you don't want a family member or a friend to find out about you? Again, nothing I would write in public where it could be read.
1. Describe your relationship with your parents. I talk to my mom once in a while but really couldn't say it's often enough to be a relationship. Sad really, but I just get busy with life and don't think about calling.
2. Do you have any siblings? What is/was that relationship like? Younger brother, and I'd still take the bullet just to do it myself, the git is taking way to many chances with his life that'll set him up for trouble if he keeps going.
3. Are there other blood relatives to whom you are close? Are there ones you can't stand? Hell, I've got such a huge family... We're all close, save a few. I've gotten side tracked from them being this far away, but I still miss them even if I don't call.
5. Who is/was your best friend? How did you meet? Amanda, The Joker's Ace. You all know that story already I'm sure.
6. Do you have other close friends? My friends have slipped on by with their lives. I still talk to some of them once in a while, but not nearly as often as I should.
7. Do you make friends easily, or do you have trouble getting along with people? I've gotten MUCH better at making friends, especially with the Pathfinder group and all that.
8. Which do you consider more important: family or friends? Refer to this entire section. lol.
9. Are you single, married, divorced, widowed? Have you been married more than once? Engaged, and married and remarried every day for two and a half years now.
10. Are you currently in a romantic relationship with someone other than a spouse? I'm with Ace, that's the only one I'm with or will be with.
11. Who was your first crush? Who is your latest? Same first crush, but of course Amanda is now here as the latest and last.
13. Do you have children? Grandchildren? If yes, how do you relate to them? If no, do you want any? I want kids, but right now it's hard to say when we'll have any. It requires cash, stability, and time. At least one of the three is almost always in flux right now.
14. Do you have any rivals or enemies? Not really anymore, life's gotten more peaceful.
15. What is your sexual orientation? Where do you fall on the Kinsey scale? Same as last time, I'm not attracted to dudes.
16. How do you feel about sex? How important is it to you? I can still take care of my own problems if need be, but it's nice to be with someone physically. It's a great way to spend time just being close to each other.
17. What are your turn-ons? Turn-offs? Weird bedroom habits? *Coughs* This list has gotten a LOT longer in the last couple years, but it's not all my story to tell so I'm going to let this one slide.
1. Do you know your astrological (zodiac sign? How well do you fit the type? I still don't hold to it really at all.
2. Is your religious, spiritual, both, or neither? How important are these elements in your life? I still don't really discuss religion, it's a hot topic that can cause way more problems than it's worth to talk about.
3. Do you have a personal code of morals or ethics? If so, how did that begin? What would it take to compromise it? Yes, and it's gotten a little longer. Not much longer, but longer.
4. How do you regard beliefs that differ from your? Are you tolerant, intolerant, curious, indifferent? I'm still very open minded and tolerant, and still want to beat the shit out of intolerant people.
1. What is your financial situation? Are you rich, poor, comfortable, in debt? Comfortable. I owe a few people, but they're assholes who screwed me over so I'm okay with it. We're not in any real trouble so I think I'd say we're good.
2. What is your social status? Has this changed over time, and if so, how has the change affected you? I'm definately not a political player, but I'm well liked by the people who happen to know me.
4. Besides the basic necessities, what do you spend your money on? I don't get much spending money, when I do I try to take Ace out for dinner. Occasionally I buy a book or something but I try not to spend much.
6. What are your interests or hobbies? How do you spend your free time? I read, play games with Amanda, run a D&D campaign. I don't write as much as I used to sadly. I wish I did.
7. What are your eating habits? Do you skip meals, eat out, drink alcohol, avoid certain foods? I've expanded my tastes a little, but I still hate fish and salad.
This section really hasn't changed much so I'm leaving it out.

1 - I want to see first the app working without registering, Can I do that?
Go to https://app.skedr.io/login and click on 'Demo Account' then click Login to sign in with our demo account. We have added 20 photos from Unsplash as a show case and we have created 4 groups with different restrictions.
We just share images to your groups. We don’t download, upload or modify any of your photos.
5 - Will Skedr send messages to any other member on my behalf?
Flickr’s API doesn’t have that functionality and anyway it’s out of the scope of the app.
We plan on the future to share interesting groups for your photos but it will suggest only. You will have to join if you want.
Flickr's API tells us that a particular photo has not been added to a group with the a code error. For the case we are using it is number 5. More information about error codes can be found here (https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.groups.pools.add.html) .
Bind any tag of your choice to one or more groups. Every photo with that tag will be added to every group that has been tagged.
For example: If you choose #landscape to be bind to 3 groups related to Landscape photography when a photo with that tag is uploaded to your photostream it will be added to those 3 groups.
In order to add a photo to a group of your choice Flickr needs writen permissions from you account.
3 - How will I know what pictures are posted in which groups?
In the groups section you can view your last 40 images added to that group. Inside Flickr you can see each of your groups where your photo belongs.
4 - We need to upload our photos to Skedr.io?
No. We don't want you to alter your workflow. Whether you work with Lightroom, Apple Photos or any kind of Flickr Uploader you will continue working as you like. We just need you to use our feature Group Tagging.
5 - My photos are not added to groups is something wrong?
We add photos every hour at 00. If you upload a photo to Flickr at 18:36 you will have to wait until next hour ( 19:00 ).
6 - Do I need to install any software?
2 - What is the purpose of Skedr.io?
The purpose is to be able to spend less time sharing your images in Flickr. Adding the same photo to groups with different Posting Limits may throttle your tries, so we are automating this for you.

I liked the bones but wasn't necessarily something I would pick for our house. However, it totally reminded me of a chair I saw on one of my favorite blogs (and I'm sure it's yours too) Young House Love.
I hope everyone has an amazing weekend! I'll be back on Monday with a fun lil office update!! (spoiler alert, I Instagramed a teaser a couple days ago. Feel free to follow: LittleHouseintheBigD).
I'm seriously drawn to them like a moth to a flame.
We already have two sets hanging in our house.
Read more about how I made this window into a picture frame HERE.
Read about that find HERE... and, if you're interested, the link to our little frame wall HERE.
So it should really surprise no one that when I found a mirrored window frame for $10 at a yard sale, I sprinted over to it, claimed it was MINE! MINE! MINE!, threw it in the back of my car and speeded off laughing menacingly I calmly approached it, asked if they would take $8 (they did), thanked them kindly, then gently put it in my lil SUV, waving as I drove off.
I know you can't really tell its a mirror from this picture since its just reflecting our fence on the other side (expertly installed by my amazingly talented and handsome husband).
I figured it might as well be worth a try.
The back of the frame was already set with a metal wire to hang.
But when Chris tried to lift it up, we both became concerned about the effect the weight would have (about 25lbs) on the wall.
I have never regretting buying a dog toy more in my life. Not only does he carrying it around with him EVERYWHERE, it has a mechanical sound chip inside (instead of a squeaker) that sounds like dogs barking... for about 10-15 seconds.
Rocky loves when Chris and I hold it or throw it for him, but he's VERY territorial over it with Gus... like a mama bear with her cub.
Rocky isn't what one would call a "sharer".
I seriously may have to hide it to bring back some peace and quiet to the house.
Chris ran out to the garage and found some hanging hooks that would hold up to 50lbs a piece (better safe than sorry, right?).
And installed them on either side of the window frame.
We next measured were we wanted it on the wall and approximately how high we wanted in relation to the ceiling and height of our settee.
Chris, bringing sexy back.... literally.
After both of us hung it, we stepped back to see if we liked it.
First thing we both noticed "It makes the room so much brighter!!".
It brings in a lot of natural light from the dining room without being too obvious.
I'm still a little on the fence if it makes that corner look too cluttered, but right now I think we both are liking it.
What do you guys think? I kinda like that it goes with the feel/theme of our home and is a lot softer than a hard piece of art or something else in that corner. I also think it make a big difference that I decluttered everything on the mantel.
P.S- If you would like to know more about our cute little settee and the story behind it, click HERE.
The reason this post has a question mark is because I'm not 100% in love with it... so I'm not 100% sure it's staying.
Don't get me wrong, our old table in the dining room is probably the saddest little table ever owned.
Don't let the cleanliness, lack of clutter, and flowers fool you. The red stain was chipped (and showing through yellow?!) and the chairs were less than comfortable.
That being said, I bought this table off Craigslist for $30 when I first moved to Dallas (it was better than sitting on suitcases and eating on cardboard boxes (true story)). It may not be the prettiest table, but it definitely worked and when compared to our awful, uncomfortable, small couch/loveseat (which we want to replace as soon as we have the moola) so the table was kind of on the back-burner.
It came with 4 chairs, table, and leaf. It was in really good shape and I asked the host of the sale if they would take $100 (thinking they would counter at $125 which I was more than willing to pay so I could flip it for possibly $300 on Craigslist) but she agreed right out on $100! SCORE!!!
Sorry the pictures aren't very good. The sale was PACKED and I am SHOCKED that no one picked up on this table before I did!!
I called Chris to celebrate... .... ... and to ask him if he would help break it down so we could get it home.
I did mention he drives a Saab, right?... as in a SEDAN...
We were only a few side streets away from home so it wasn't nearly THAT bad.
What I DIDN'T expect is how much Chris would like the table. I knew it was in really good shape, but Chris LOVED it! I agreed to set it up in the dining room (if it didnt work out, I still would need pictures for Craigslist).
For me, I think its a bit too tall for such a small room.
Don't get me wrong, I think its a MAJOR upgrade from what we had! I even agreed to post our old table on Craigslist and keep this one to see if I would grow on me. (Spoiler alert: We sold it for $100 in one day which makes this whole table upgrade 100% FREE!!!).
Here's a bit closer looks so you can really see the wood inlay.
Its a gorgeous table, and I think we are going to keep it for now, but there are still two things that bother me.
- I think it would look a LOT better if our ceilings were just a foot higher, but I think the tall table just makes the room look a bit "shrunk".
- If we have more than 2 people over, we don't have any other chairs the same height. I'm thinking this might be remedied by getting a set of leather accent chairs to go at either end, but so far I haven't found anything. (UPDATE: We actually did find some AWESOME accent chairs on craigslist for $25 a pop! Click HERE to check them out!).
P.S- Tomorrow is the last day for the Home Depot give card giveaway. If you like free money, enter HERE.
Ok, maybe not Date "Night", but Date "Day Auction" sounds a bit "swinger-ie" for us... like we are looking for something besides tile and counter tops. (But if you're into that, its fine... to each their own...).
Anyway, as I posted last Friday, Chris and I go to this auction every time its in town, so it IS our sorta multi-annual date outing. If it wasn't for the AC going out on us a couple weeks ago, we would actually be in prep mode to start redoing the kitchen... alas, we cant start that until we pay off the new AC in full (our goal is by the end of the year if we are really strict).
So as we drove up, we had to kept repeating to ourselves that we were "just looking"...
Beginning of a bad horror movie? Could be...
"They thought they were going to an marble and granite auction... but they were actually being lured to their doom....".
However, once we got inside, we were greeted by one of the planners (a lady we talk to every time we go. She even told us she hoped she would see us this auction and thought about us when they announced they were doing another auction in Dallas... awww we made friends!) so we felt right at home and started looking around.
First thing that caught my eye were these beautiful 12x12 marble tiles...
Auction day, these went for $3.50 a sq ft... Chris and I thought they would look awesome in a bathroom.
Wouldnt really work in our house, but pretty fun and funky... (sorry I dont know how much these went for :-(.
Next were some counter-tops that I've had my eyes on since our first auction.
Beautiful travertine (which would look AWESOME with our travertine tiles that are going to be on the floor). But Chris said the fact that the counters arent sealed or polished means they can be really porous which would be trouble down the line. (sigh)... I think these went for $250 for each 7ft slab.
I thought these would be pretty and bright in an entry way... .. ... of that mansion we are someday going to own.
Actually, now looking at the width of these, I think they are pavers... whatever they were, they were gorgeous... especially at a only $1 a sq ft.
Walking around, of course I wanted these.
Oh, and this sink to go with it....
Going back to stuff that was a little more practical, I thought these travertine tile mosaics were really pretty.
I liked the diamond pattern but wasn't too sure of how it would look with the tiles next to each other and grout in between.
We then started to look at some back-splash options.
I really liked the texture of these travertine subway tiles, but Chris added that they would be REALLY hard to clean if we ever got bacon grease or any food on them... (and of course we would)...
They had some other options of the travertine floors we actually bought last time...
At $185 a slab, I really liked these since they looked a lot lighter than everything else (our kitchen is so small, we need to keep it light and bright to make it look bigger).
My fear is that they would be too heavy... they are pretty though.
We were just about to leave, until I saw THIS and froze...
The heavens opened, the angels sang, and Chris said, "oh no, you saw it"... LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO HIDE IT!!!
True, I did made a big scene (squealed like a Bieber-loving-14-year-old, clapped my hands like a retarded seal, and ran over to give it a hug) but he still shouldn't have tried to hide them.
THIS is exactly what I want in our kitchen!
The white and grey tones would totally compliment our white cabinets and I think the marble look is sophisticated, elegant, and classic.
Well, not really, but I tried my best to plead to Chris about how these counter tops and back-splash would complete my life and I would never ask for anything again as long as we were married.
Sadly, it didnt work. He also reminded me of the $7,500 AC bill and we were NOT in the market for redoing our kitchen just yet.
I then tried to see if we could switch the topic by just getting ONE and doing the less expensive bathroom project first (using the counter as a bathroom vanity) and that ALMOST worked... But sadly went home empty handed.
If its fate, it will be there next time I guess. The counters went for $250 a slab during the auction and the backsplash for $7.00 a sq ft.
Price wise, the counters (with 3 corners already bullnosed) would have been $17.58 a sq ft, before fabrication and installation. Does anyone know how much that would cost? I know a lot of place's prices include the stone, all cut work, and installation, but has anyone ever just bought the stone then gotten it installed? If anyone has done this, I would love to know your take on the experience!
So what did you guys like best? The travertine flooring? My gorgeous marble counters? Or maybe you are into greek goddess busts? Also, if you have any questions about the auction, I would love to help and answer as much as I can for you!
P.S- Don't forget! The Home Depot gift card giveaway is still going on and runs through Thursday night... Click HERE to enter!
P.P.S- Anyone worried about Marble being a "soft stone" or not being good for kitchens, please read THIS... It definitely put our minds at ease.

Walking Through the Land of God's Promises (Part 6).

Hellsing – Nazi’s and vampires, physician what’s not to like? The story is meh, but it’s unapologetically over the top. Although the last episode is the main bad guy talking for about 40 minutes, which is boring.
Attack on Titan – A few of my coworkers told me about this one, and I’m glad I watched it. It’s basically about humanity trapped within walls, and on the outside are these huge humanoid creatures (titans) that will eat you. The story follows a group of three friends as they deal with their lives falling apart.
My Neighbor Totoro – Hayao Miyazaki’s classic where nothing really happens and it’s a totally feel good easy going movie. Here’s a good discussion of it on the incomparable. Then one of my coworkers told me that both girls are dead and totoro is a death god. What?
Been watching a lot of anime lately. Here’s the breakdown:.
Blood + : I’m not sure how I like this one yet, this site but it does have it’s classic moments. It also has quite possibly the best opening to a show EVER. Here it is on YouTube, I’ll give you a hint, it’s at the 44 second mark.
Claymore: Another anime with beasts pretending to be human. Weird theme going on with me picking these two to watch at the same time. I’ve only seen 4 episodes, but it seems ok so far.
Mushi-shi: I saw this as an ad on AnimeNewsNetwork, and the ad actually worked in the fact that it got my attention. After looking at the reviews on ANN I decided to uh… obtain it. I’ve watched the first two episodes, and they’re pretty low-key, which is a nice change to the first two anime’s I mentioned here, where someone usually gets cut in half in every episode.
I’d like to write up a longer one after I finish watching the series, pathopsychology but for now, approved here is a short one.
I’ll get into it more later. I think I’ll start an anime category for this stuff.

Quality of the unit is fine. I had two issues with the lock.
First, is that is not compatible with a Mooney baggage door lock. This is not a fault of the manufacturer, it just didn't work in my application without major modifications.
Second, the key is double sided which means it is a pain to have a duplicate made. I wouldn't buy another just because of the double sided key.
Is the key turning radius 90 or 180 degrees?

The cost to develop an app depends on two things: a) what devices you’re developing for and b) the project type you want to build.
Before calling an app developer or a development team, first ask yourself what you’re developing your app for – iPhone, iPhone 4, iPhone 6, iPad, or fall all of this device? This will help you be clear about what you want and save a lot of time, energy, and money down the road.
Second, the cost of developing an app also depends on the project type you’re building.
The cost of developing a simple (table-based) app is anywhere between $1000 and $4,000, approximately.
You’ll have to provide the content, instructions, and examples of apps to your developer or developing a team. However, if you know Photoshop, you can create your own graphics and submit them to your developer or development team, which will help bring the cost down to $1,500.
The cost may further rise if you want to include additional features – social media integration, GPS locators, among others – into your new app.
The cost to build a database-driven app could range between $8,000 and $50,000. Again, you’ll have to provide everything – content, image, audio. The cost will further rise from creating logic for the app and architecting the gameplay and the usability.
The cost of game apps is very difficult to predict, but the standard cost ranges between $10,000 to $250,000. Did you know: Angry Birds cost $125k to $180k to develop?
According to some hardcore game developers, many racing games that use gyroscope will cost you at least $125,000. And that’s only for the code.
But the biggest advantage of developing a game app: they get more downloads than any other apps discussed here.
For marketers, nothing can be super viral than promoting an app game that is super fun to play.
So instead of worrying about “it’s so expensive building a game app,” think about “how much do I need to invest to make a FUN game app now?”.
This will help you get the most out of your investment.
This feature allows users to buy full versions of your apps.
The cost – $1,000 to $3,000 – is spread into in-app purchasing, the complexity, and whether you’d like to build everyone into the first app or if you want to run it from a server.
The cost of having a web service feature into your app is somewhere between $1,000 to $5,000.
Rather than making changes to the code every time you make an update, the web services feature allows you to update content automatically using XML files.
Before using web services into your new app, talk with your developer or development team to save yourself a lot of headaches in the future.
This feature will cost you $1,000; it can be easily integrated with the SDK, thanks to Apple.
This feature – basic integration of social media (Facebook, Twitter) and emailing, as well as another type of integrations, such as WordPress website – will cost you additional $500 to $1,500.
The SDKs are vital tools that keep track of your app and help you generate more ROIs. It will cost you $50 to $200 to include this feature into your newly created app.
You can easily integrate any SDK for a relatively cheap price, but as you become more specific to your needs, it can get pretty expensive.
The app design plays a huge role on your overall ROIs and enhancing user engagement and experience. App designs convert a casual viewer to download your apps and make them feel more engaged. Therefore, investing in a good mobile app design is a sure-fire way to increase your profits.
Hiring a web designer to design a mobile app is your best option here; talk to a mobile designer who has a knowledge of the space restrictions (smaller screen size of mobile) and user flow.
And when you open this graphic package, you’ll be shocked when you find so many different design pieces included there – an icon alone requires around 4 different sizes for a universal app (that works on both iPhone and iPad).
Here’s the breakdown of your app design costs:.
Expect the cost to be somewhere between $500- $10,000.At this price, you can easily get a base level design for your app. But remember, this simple design will not be done for retina display (as found on iPhone 4), as they require high-resolution files.
Send this design to your developer who will then add all the images in the code.
Tip: Rename the files in the package before sending them to your developer; it’ll help save both of your time and a lot of headaches.
Add 25% extra to the above cost to make your app compatible with iPhone 6+. All the images will be resized at 2208 x 1242px, which is more than 2 times the 640x 1136px sizes for iPhone 5.
For iPad, add an extra 50 % to the above cost; we assume the layout and user flow is very similar. In most cases, you’ll also have to consider creating alternate functionality to accommodate for the iPad size and speed, which, of course, requires new designs.
IPads often contain retina images, which are big in size. Keep an eye on the file size of your code when developing.
The entire package should also include all the icons. If you need, ask for screenshots from the designers.
We’ll say it again – do not cut corners on design; you’ll have much difficulty recuperating your investments later.
So, the total costs of your app would be….
You’ll pay $99 to Apple as an annual fee to list your app on Apple Store – no hidden fees.
Each time you make an app sale, Apple will then take a 30% cut.
Think about spending your money on three things: app development, app design, and app IT architecture (hosting your app on servers, etc).
So the total cost of an app will vary based on all these variables listed above.
Of course, you can find a company that’ll do everything for you for $1,000 or so, but you’ll have to keep an eye on the quality and how much control you’ll have over the entire process.
For now, forget about how much you’ll pay to develop an app.
Instead, ask yourself what strategies and features will bring you the highest returns on investment.
Even if you let your app sit in the store for a year or two, taking some time for app marketing and tracking progress on a regular basis will help you recover your investment easily.
Take a look at this app, for example, it costs only $2,500, drives about 3k new visitors to a website every month, with average time on site more than 400% than website visitors.
The numbers given above are highly variable – they may either go up or go down depending on many things – but remember, as the competition will go up, the cost of developing an app will come down.
For now, avoid falling for a story of a high school teenager who says he/she can build an app like Angry Bird for just $1,000. Also, be careful of companies demanding $250k to develop a simple database driven app; you don’t want to feel that you just paid a quarter million dollars for an app.
And lastly, remember, if you’re going to spend that amount of money, better be prepared to get something incredible.
What do you think? How much will it cost to develop and app? Please comment below.

How would you describe your relationship with plants?
We consider the plants that share our house, balcony and studio, along with Aru our dog, as part of the family. We speak to them and grow really attached to them.
Recent scientific researches have proven that plants can move, communicate, react to external stimulus, even have memories of past experiences! This new awareness necessarily brought about a new and more respectful attitude towards them. Our Phytophiler projects simply go in that direction: they are not do-it-all tools – they don’t water for you, they don’t feed the plants for you – because we wanted to bring people closer and make them more engaged with the plants.
How do you see your role as product designers when it comes to plants?

This whole season may just have to be a wash for the Blue Jays and Bisons. It's not what either of them expected.
The Bisons are careening to their 12th straight non-playoff season spanning three parent clubs. A team that started the season 13-5 and was still eight games over .500 in early June just put up the most losses in any month in its history.
The constant run of injuries in the big leagues has drawn a lot of scrutiny from the Toronto media because it seems counterintuitive to the Jays' initiative of having a new "high performance department." Some things are flukes. But all the muscle pulls seem like they could be more preventable than they are. And the trickledown effect really hurts in the minors.
One disappointment that's really hurt at all levels is the wrist surgery for top outfield prospect Anthony Alford. He was lighting things up at Double-A New Hampshire batting .325 and the Blue Jays wanted to give him a brief look. He would have then come to Buffalo and ostensibly anchored the lineup. But he's yet to arrive and the season has gone down the drain.
Enjoy the beer, hot dogs and Celery's quest for a victory this summer. The standings are shot as far as the Bisons go. Again.
"He's obviously frustrated. Whenever anyone steals seven bases, Miggy gets frustrated," Rizzo said. "It's his second time barking in the media and not just going to his teammates. It's something as a veteran like he is, you'd think he'd make smarter decisions about it.
"When you point fingers you're a selfish player. We have another catcher that throws everyone out. "This is all over TV last night. Now I gotta talk about it today. We win as 25 lose as 25. To call teammates out? What’s the point?".
Good point. There's an old phrase in sports about keeping things in house. Montero didn't abide by it and he's gone. He should have known better.
The Braves had no use for a 44-year-old pitcher so they designated Bartolo Colon for assignment. But the Mets certainly need another arm and a reunion seems more than a little plausible.
"The reality is that I've been getting hit hard and that's the truth and you can't dance around it," said Colon, a 15-game winner last season.
Gose's last four outings, however, have been impressive: Five hitless innings with eight strikeouts and no walks. A high school pitcher in California, Gose has reportedly been in the high 90s at several points in his stint.
---The Indians continue to be concerned with the health of manager Terry Francona. For the second time this season, he left a game early last week and turned over the reins to bench coach Brad Mills because he was feeling light-headed. Francona underwent a battery of tests to rule out any serious illness and said it was a case of his blood pressure dropping. At age 58, Francona has had knee and hip replacements, and it's reasonable to wonder how he will do traveling to the All-Star Game in Miami and returning to his normal gig rather than taking those four days off.
---Ichiro Suzuki started a game in center field for the Marlins last week, making him the oldest center field in history. Elias Sports said Ichiro, at 43 years and 246 days old, broke the record of Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson. He was 43-211 when he made his last start in center for the Red Sox on July 24, 2002.

The rock on this image I thought of as being an elephant. Seen from behind.
And then our guide was taking a rest while we were looking for birds.
We continued to a wetland. And I was unlucky, I got stuck on a root, stumbled, ans fell to the ground. Nothing broken or was hurt. Except for my pride of course. Never happened before. Well, this turned out to be a great little pond with nice waders and other waterfowls. Red-kneed Dotterel was among them.
We were passing a lot of plantations which I think was apple trees. Covered with nets. Probably protection against too many birds. We also made a stop at a mast for phone. That´s where I heard bellfirds the first time.
I was tired and fell asleep with the computer in my knee. No shower that evening :).
I'm glad your foot and ankle were not hurt from your falls. That was another very long day in my opinion but you did see some good birds. The King Parrot in the setting sun is especially nice.
Those boulders are certainly huge. Sorry to hear about the fall, but glad it was just your shoe causing the problems and not something more serious. You seem to be enjoying your travels in my Australian world.
Your guide made for an interesting character shot.

At the meeting of May 20, 1767, "On a motion made it was agreed unanimously, That no copy of any minute or minutes of the Convention, be given to any person except a member, without a particular order of the Convention.".
It should also be stated that the letter of Dr. Stiles to the Secretary was not the only animadversion made upon the course pursued by the Convention. An attack had been publicly made upon the Convention, which had drawn out a letter in its defence from the Secretary, published in Mr. Game's Gazette of Monday, March 28, 1768, being as follows:0.

The project culminated in an exhibition, which took place in the UCT psychology department on 1 June, where participants displayed their photo stories, thereby taking ownership of their own narratives.
[Text above reads] “As a Trans person, much like the sea-snails’ trail in this photograph, I struggle to find direction on my journey sometimes – in terms of transition as well as life-wise and career-wise. My path through transitioning feels like it has been going in circles for years, and whenever I get close to progress I somehow end up going in the complete wrong direction.”.
What does it mean to be a young trans person in Cape Town?
For the past year, Pitcher has been facilitating a PhotoVoice project with a group of trans young adults.
“This specific project focused on young trans people’s experiences, about what it means to be a young trans person in Cape Town today,” Pitcher explained.
Pitcher’s project forms part of a larger effort within the Department of Psychology to work with young people on matters of identity, gender and sexuality. They favour the PhotoVoice method, which brings to the fore the knowledge and experiences of young people in relation to their identities.
“We find that much of the research being done by psychologists and other social scientists tends to produce knowledge from an adult perspective that centres adult questions and ways of working,” said Associate Professor Dr Floretta Boonzaier, who supervised this project.
“PhotoVoice projects aim to create spaces where those who have historically not been given a platform can share their experiences through photography and storytelling,” said Pitcher.
In this way, PhotoVoice presents a challenge. It allows for the world to be viewed from perspectives that differ from those who have traditionally been in control of narratives.
The project was run as a collaboration between the Triangle Project – a Cape Town-based non-profit organisation offering services to protect and promote the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ+) people – and UCT, a partnership that was brought together by the UCT Knowledge Co-Op.
“When we were approached to be a part of this project, it was a natural fit,” explained Matthew Clayton, the Triangle Project’s research, advocacy and policy coordinator.
“It is about letting people control their own narratives and shaping conversations and, especially for LGBTIQ+ people, shaping those conversations away from what other people want to speak about (sex and death, for example) is very important,” Clayton said.
“Our project doesn’t claim to represent all young trans people in Cape Town or South Africa. We worked with a very small group of people, and it is just an insight into their experiences at a particular point in time and in a particular social and political context,” said Pitcher.
The project, which culminated in an exhibition in the psychology department on 1 June, aims to disrupt and hopefully change the way trans bodies are spoken about within psychology and psychiatry.
The exhibition serves two purposes, Pitcher explained. “Firstly, to create a space where young trans people can share their photo narratives and represent their identity on their own terms. Secondly, exhibitions are visually powerful events that can contribute to awareness around social issues and facilitate change.
“I think it is very significant that this exhibition is taking place within the psychology department, because psychology and psychiatry as disciplines have very problematic histories with trans people and trans bodies and identities, in terms of pathologising them. That is still something that is very much ongoing today.”.
Pitcher’s hope is that this work will contribute to more affirming research.

Interesting post, John. I rarely hear poetry read aloud and I completely don't think it's better that way. I think it totally depends on who's performing it.
I do enjoy listening to poetry out loud (my Billy Collins CD is great!) when the poet or performer is skilled. But even then, I want/need to have the written word to refer to, then or later. I can't absorb nearly enough from audio versions--whether live or recorded--to take in a poem to the extent that I want to. And I've heard some poets whose work I love read those same poems, and had it be quite a letdown.
Thanks for getting my brain thinking about this!
I enjoy poems both ways - on the page and aloud. Reading them aloud myself is sometimes good, too - I get to read and hear them that way.
Can you do me a favor and shoot me an email at kelly at kellyfineman dot com so I can contact you about the CYBILS? Finalists have been named, and I'm going to set up a Yahoo! group for judges, but I'll be needing info from you for that. Thanks!

Kate Winslet and Idris Elba are strangers who must rely on each other to survive after a plane crash.
If you like seeing beautiful people stranded in remote wilderness and struggling to survive, then “The Mountain Between Us” is going to be the fall movie for you. Marking the English-language debut of Dutch-Palestinian filmmaker Hany Abu-Assad, who has been nominated twice for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars, the survival drama stars Idris Elba and Kate Winslet as strangers who must rely on each other after a plane crash leaves them stranded on a mountain top.
The official synopsis from 20th Century Fox reads: “Stranded after a tragic plane crash, two strangers must forge a connection to survive the extreme elements of a remote snow covered mountain. When they realize help is not coming, they embark on a perilous journey across hundreds of miles of wilderness, pushing one another to endure and discovering strength they never knew possible.”.
“The Mountain Between Us” is scheduled for release on October 20. While it doesn’t look like it will be an awards player, the combined star power of Elba and Winslet should make it an attractive bit of counter-programming for adult moviegoers. Watch the trailer below:.

Many families enjoy re-telling the events that happened around the time that someone was born – the mad dash to the hospital, nervous pacing in the waiting room, funny names that your parents almost gave you.
This year for two nights we are going to talk about Mary and Joseph’s journey, too!
Let’s consider the realities of Jesus as a baby – a real, live, crying baby with demands to be fed and comforted. Let’s enter into the challenges and mysteries that faced Mary and Joseph as they prepared for and welcomed their son – God’s son.
Sometime this December, enjoy a few quiet moments together with your loved ones as you invite Jesus to be born in your home, in your family and in our community.
GATHER your family around a table or other flat surface.
INVITE the children to arrange the figures and other items in the basket (and even the basket itself) into a scene.
What are the things that families do to get ready for a baby?
Any preparations Mary and Joseph made were interrupted by their need to travel. Mary might have brought along the cloths that she used to wrap Jesus; they used an animal feeding trough as his crib. Do you think Jesus’ birth happened in a way that Mary and Joseph expected? How does it feel when things don’t happen the way we expect them to?
God’s Son, Jesus, did not come in the way anyone expected him to. What might the people in Bethlehem have done differently if they had known it was Jesus, the Messiah, about to be born in their town?
Additional questions to ponder with older children and adults:.
Imagine how Mary and Joseph must have felt as they found there wasn’t room for them. What kind of pressure was Joseph under? What fears might Mary have had?
GATHER your family around the scene that was created the previous day.
INVITE the children to pack the figurines and other items back into the basket and offer a prayer for the next family who will host them.
Additional questions to talk about with older children and adults:.
Read Philippians 2:5-11. Verse 8 tells us that Jesus “humbled himself”. What did Jesus give up when he became not only a human but a baby? What do we learn from this example about what humility looks like?
Tonight we asked the question, “What kinds of things do babies do?” I’m sure the list included some pretty “earthy” things. For every stage of Jesus’ life we could make a similar list. He got tired, hurt, sick, and sad. What is your gut reaction to this list? In what ways does it fit or not fit with your ideas about who Jesus is?

When I try to post a request for an item, the request window flickers and gets smaller and smaller until it's just a narrow little strip.
I am having the same issues, been happening now for several days. Been unable to post anything.
For several days now i've been unable to post. When i click on an item to post for help it just pops up, flickers and only shows top line of box. Does not allow me to post for any help.
"Post" screen goes up and down, then gets smaller. Cannot post for anything on FB. Every time there a new quest, something goes wrong.
There have been issues for a while now and just going to have to be patient until they are all worked out with posting items for the Wall posts on Facebook or even Zynga.
There are many threads already on these issues so keep watch with those as well.
Hello, Farmers. This is now being investigated by the team and they're working on fixing it so you'll be able to post for requests again. We'll update you through our Hot Topics article as soon as this gets resolved. Thank you for understanding.
Patience all. Not everything can be fixed at a snap or when you want it to be.
Don't count on them providing the help for the quests or extending them. They won't do it. Could be issue is something on your end and not necessarily Z's with the Frame issue or anything.
Yes this issue not being looked at fully to work who knows if someone just doesn't like us being able to do what we were doing and thought we had it to easy to ask for items in the Temp Feed or something on Zynga side.
Yes, it's a known issue, the workaround has been posted on the forum several times in great detail. I think most of the guides have since been deleted by Moderators. You are able to retrieve the link via the developer tools if you know how to use them.
Alternatively, you can just post your profile link in the Temp feed, so friends can visit and click for the items.

Almost 2 million millennials are hoping to pass on their old paper £10 notes by using them to pay back money that they owe their friends, according to a new survey published today (Thursday 1 March 2018) by Paym, the UK’s mobile payments service.
According to the research, across the UK population as a whole, 1.95 million people (3% of respondents) would try to use their old £10 notes to settle IOUs with friends. Amazingly, they are almost all millennials – more than a million (1.22 million) are 18-24, with a further 600,000 people aged between 25-34.
The survey results also show that 10% of people will attempt to spend their old notes in shops, 44% will attempt to exchange their notes at a bank while, 1% say they will simply throw any old notes into the bin.
More than 40,000 tenners are now sent every month using Paym, the easy way to pay friends using just their mobile number. In total, more than 1 million individual £10 payments have been made using the service since it launched in 2014, with some of the most popular reasons to send money including paying back for a meal (15%) or chipping in for petrol money (18%) or bills (20%).
“Paper tenners go out of circulation after 1 March, so remember to spend them before then or exchange them at a bank. And if you want to go cashless that’s no problem either – Paym lets you pay back friends and family using just their mobile number, whether it’s for £10 or more.”.
3. Hot toddy– It is traditional to serve whisky but you can make a cheaper twist on this by making pitchers of hot toddy with a cheaper whisky, all you need to add is honey, lemon and water. Here is a simple recipe.
4. Free entertainment– the timetable for the evening and the poems and toasts you need to read out are all available for free online, why not just bring them up on your tablet computer to pass around? You can also access lots of free traditional Scottish music on YouTube or on a music streaming service like Spotify if you already subscribe.
5. Dessert– A money saving idea is to ask your guests to bring along a dessert each and lay them out at the end so that everyone can help themselves to a bit of what they like; you can also ask any guests who are particular about their whisky to bring along their favourite one to share.

Yes, that’s a thing! Before buying anything, you should ask yourself these questions:.
Can I afford it? If that is also a ‘no, don’t even dare thinking about purchasing.
Can I get it cheaper anywhere else? If you have answered both of the questions above with a ‘yes’, check online if you can find a more reasonable price. (and don’t forget cashback!).

Maybe your mum really liked that handbag she (not so subtly) pointed out while you were shopping the other day, but it’s a teeny bit outside of your budget.

New research from Paym, the UK’s mobile payments service, has found that one third (33%) of stag and hen do organisers were not paid on time by party participants attending pre-wedding celebrations, with the average amount owed at almost £250.
Long gone are the days when stag and hen parties involved a night at the local pub with a bag of chips for dinner. Nowadays stag and hen dos can take a whole weekend to celebrate. In the past year, almost 1 in 5 (18%) people partied in Europe. For the rest, London was the most popular single UK destination for both stags (11%) and hens (5%).
As destinations have become more ambitious, the stag and hen do shopping list has become longer including items such as travel, accommodation, day and night activities, and last but not least, themed outfits. It comes as no surprise in that case that the average cost of a stag do per person is £140 with the average cost for a hen party coming in slightly more at £146… a lot of money if you’re having to pursue multiple partygoers for payment!
Average cost of a stag and hen do per person, by region:.
Chasing stag and hen party members for money is often a thankless task, especially once the fun’s over, but according to Paym’s survey, this may all depend on where you live. Guests from Scotland were least likely to pay on time for activity costs, whilst those from Greater London took the top spot for reliability when paying on time.
Who performs best for paying on time for stag and hen parties:.
It’s no coincidence therefore that stag and hen party revellers from Greater London were also found to have the greatest awareness of Paym (36%), the simple and secure way of making or receiving a payment using just a mobile number. Paym is already included in fifteen banks and building societies’ apps, so there’s nothing new to download to be able to use a phone number to pay straight from one bank account to another, and there’s no need for any sort codes or account numbers.
So one more important addition to the organiser’s ‘pre-do’ checklist is to make sure you’ve registered your mobile number with your bank to enable party participants to pay via Paym. You never know, next time you might just receive 100% of payments on time. To register now, go to: Paym.co.uk.
“Hen and stag parties have become a firm fixture of pre-wedding celebrations, and the pressure is on for organisers to please brides and grooms-to-be. Costs can mount, especially for those arranging travel and activities. But with mobile banking more popular than ever, there’s little reason why organisers should have to chase for payment from stag and hen party participants.
Paym enables more than 20 million customers of fifteen banks and building societies who use mobile banking to securely and quickly pay back friends, families and small businesses using just their mobile number.”.
As a subtle reminder to stag and hen do revellers, Paym has launched a video showing how it can make or break a late payer’s pre-wedding celebration experience. An infographic illustrating the findings in this press release, is here.
2,600 adults aged 16+ were interviewed from 27 June to 6 July 2017 via Online Business Survey, undertaken by TNS, for this story.
Nine in 10 (87%) flatmates find living with a couple creates negative feelings when it comes to money.
New research from Paym, the UK’s mobile payments service, has found almost nine in 10 (87%) flatmates believe living with a couple creates negative feelings, particularly when it comes to finances. And over a quarter (27%) state having to discuss finances with a couple is more awkward than in a more traditional flatshare.
While couples may be adopting a ‘what’s mine is yours’ approach, other not so loved-up housemates can end up feeling out of pocket with over a third (38%) saying that living with a couple makes dividing bills more complicated.
Friends or partners who stay in the house but don’t contribute 18%.
Having to pay for something you don’t use (e.g.TV sports package) 15%.
People who never chip in for one-off payments (e.g. buying food for shared Sunday lunch ) 12%.
Flatmates who stay at home during the day but don’t contribute more to utilities than others 11%.
With over half of Brits (53%) using their mobiles to discuss finances with their flatmates, technology can also be used to help the payback process, ensuring the financial burden is balanced across singles, couples and guests – with minimal fuss and chasing. Paym allows you to pay back flatmates, friends and family at least £250 a day via your banking app using just their mobile number.
“By using mobile numbers, which many of us know already or have in our contact list, Paym allows you to immediately pay back and be paid back the exact amount, without having to resort to running tabs, IOUs or arguments.”.
Group chats – With over a quarter (26%) of flatmates finding the awkwardness of asking to be paid back for bills their biggest issue, group chats using mobile messenger services can be an easy way to broach the conversation without confronting or targeting one particular person.
Create a calendar – A shared calendar to remind everyone when big bills are due means the responsibility isn’t left to one person.
Communal can be convivial – Don’t forget that sharing can be fun, why not try organising a weekly flat meal to get everyone together and enjoy the perks that come with sharing a home?
They say don’t sweat the small stuff, but the study found the source of most conflict in flatshares is the small, informal bills. Over a third (36%) state not being paid back for little things (such as bin bags and washing up liquid) is their biggest grievance.
Surprisingly, the research in partnership with Next Big Thing found that forgetting to pay back flatmates for more significant bills – such as rent and utilities – caused less upset with this only ranking as the third (25%) biggest issue up and down the UK.
The awkwardness of having to ask housemates to pay a bill 26%.
These more informal and irregular costs may seem like small change but they can soon add up with over a third of house sharers (36%) losing out between £11-25 a month and almost a fifth (18%) losing over £100 or more a month.
Eventually, flatmates can pay even a higher price with over one in ten (13%) experiencing such tricky situations that a housemate has had to move out.
With over half of Brits (53%) using their mobiles to discuss finances with their flatmates, technology can also be used to help the payback process. Paym allows you to pay back flatmates, friends and family at least £250 a day using just their mobile number, ideal for sorting those bills both big and small.
“While paying for utilities and rent are the bills we rarely forget, our research shows it’s not these big bills that cause problems. Small items such as milk, bread and bin bags – that are often too insignificant to mention – are usually the cause of the greatest conflict for flatsharers in the UK, as these costs can add up surprisingly quickly”.
Group chats – With over a quarter (26%) of flatmates finding the awkwardness of asking housemates to be paid back for bills their biggest issue, group chats can be an easy way to broach the conversation without confronting or targeting one particular person.
Communal can be convivial – Don’t forget that sharing can be fun, why not try organising a weekly flat meal to get everyone together and enjoy the perks that come with sharing a home.

Not really sure because I'm just trying to do what hasn't been done before. Plus, my stuff is just all over the place when it comes to region.

Winnipeg faces significant demographic changes in the years ahead, both in terms of our overall population as well as our cultural diversity. Embracing those changes and building an inclusive community will be essential to ensuring our city has a strong future.
According to the report, Winnipeg ranks 6th among Canadian cities when it comes to immigration, stating, “The Toronto area receives the largest share of Canada’s immigrants. In 2013, Toronto saw approximately 81,800 immigrants, followed by Montreal (43,950), Vancouver (29,450), Calgary (17,505), Edmonton (12,717), and then Winnipeg (11,100).”.
This growth and diversity is a great thing, as Winnipeg can be a positive example to Canada, and the world when it comes to embracing diversity, respecting our Indigenous heritage, and building a diverse and equitable community. However, as we have seen, there is more work to be done to get there. Just recently, a Winnipeg day care was targeted with racist pamphlets. Additionally, the well-known Maclean’s article on racism that created an intense amount of discussion demonstrates that Winnipeg faces some challenges on the road to achieving our full potential.
While addressing prejudice and promoting inclusivity is important first and foremost because it is the right thing to do, it is also going to be essential to the economic prospects of our city.
“Migration has become an increasingly important factor for population growth, and Winnipeg’s ability to attract new migrants will continue to be an important determinant of its future economic potential,” the report continues.
Indeed, it is clear that Winnipeg’s future economic prospects will depend on new Canadians.
“Winnipeg is expected to attract an average of more than 9,500 net international migrants each year from 2012 to 2035. Although the population will age as baby boomers retire, increased levels of immigration will help support growth in Winnipeg’s labour force.”.
With these facts in mind - and while remaining aware of the struggles our city faces - there is reason to be optimistic about the future of Winnipeg. We have many leaders who are stepping up and taking action to create a better view of our city.
This, as well as the One Winnipeg initiative, are important steps to embracing openness and inclusion in our city. As leaders continue to step up, we have every reason to believe that the future of Winnipeg will be bright and hopeful.

Time Period: Every Night, Every Day.
Area of Influence: As far as you can see from Bryce.
The first star to appear may actually be a planet, but it is soon followed by Vega, Arcturus and other bright stars. Two hours after sunset comes the combined light of over a billion stars, all too distant to be seen individually by the human eye. Behold, the Milky Way! This stellar strip of light is only a portion of one of our galaxy's spiral arms. What does an entire galaxy look like?
Look to the north. Draw a line from Mizar, the middle star in the Big Dipper's handle through the North Star eastward past the zigzag-shaped constellation of Cassiopeia, and you will come to a tiny fuzzy cloud known as M31. This is our sister galaxy, Andromeda, the largest and most distant object visible to the naked eye, measuring 110,000 light years in diameter!
What are the consequences of Bryce Canyon's air quality and viewshed preservation efforts? You'll probably need a flashlight while walking around our visitor center, our campgrounds, and even the Lodge area at night. If you're visiting us by tour bus don't expect your coach to be air-conditioned (or heated depending on season) upon your return from viewing an overlook. In an effort to preserve both natural quiet and air quality, our Park Rangers are instructed to fine tour bus operators $50 (at minimum) for leaving bus engines running while parked.
On the plus side, Bryce Canyon offers special Ranger Programs about the night sky throughout our summer season, where our staff will be overjoyed to share with you the wonders of a dark sky.
Even the National Park Service struggles to comply with these efforts. In rural settings, forest fire smoke is a chief source of air pollution. New air quality guidelines are confounding our prescribed fire efforts. In an effort to maintain healthy biologically diverse forests, we have to be careful not to obscure the world class scenery and viewsheds we are also charged with protecting.
Another form of air quality that we monitor is natural quiet. In key places throughout the park, we have equipment recording background noise to establish a baseline. The next question we will soon be facing is "What should a National Park sound like?".

Happy Weekend! While I recover from a few days of shooting new Missions I thought I'd share with you the latest episode that aired yesterday.

So I have no problem attempting to explain complex things to him, like the large-scale electronic structure theory and the manner in which it can provide potential energy surfaces and force fields for simulating intricate chemical processes important to technology and biological chemistry.
“Don’t you think that’s a little too advanced and time-consuming for a 1-year-old?” my wife asked when I set out to convey such a complicated dissertation to our baby.
“Maybe,” I said. “But I’m not telling him he’s too young to understand. That’s belittling.”.
As Memorial Day drew near, my now 9-year-old son has been talking about what the last Monday in May means. In particular, he spoke of proper American flag etiquette. He thought flying our flag upside down was only a sign of disrespect. He also thought that burning our flag only meant hatred for our country.
My son’s well-being is my sworn duty, and I shall not rest, I promised at his birth, if he is ill-informed. My mission: To answer his 3 million flag questions, even though I might not have the answers.
“No, no, no,” my wife said to me. She knew we all were in for pain if I submitted to this dialogue. Or she just had a honey-do list she wanted me to work on instead.
A honey-do list it was. It seemed like an easy enough list to finish.
Who was I kidding? The two-day American flag discourse was much easier.
“So,” I said to my son, “you want to know more about Old Glory, eh?”.
And just like that, we were on our way.
After a brief, 4-hour origin story about Old Glory, my son went in for easier questions like: Can the flag be flown at night? (Only if it has satisfactory illumination.) What if you don’t have satisfactory illumination? (Raise the flag at sunrise and take it down at sunset.).
Then, to set the kid straight on a few things he learned in school, I told him the flag could, in fact, be burned, but only during proper flag-burning procedures as a means to retire a weather-beaten or otherwise tattered Stars and Stripes. The flag could also be flown upside, but only as a distress signal.
My son was no dummy. He had no problems understanding what I was saying.
The more difficult questions were yet to come. But I rose to the occasion. With great oratory skill, I made my son understand the importance of the American flag.
“I don’t get the importance of the American flag,” he said.
We were getting nowhere. How do you explain that type of symbolism to a 9-year-old? How do you explain why service men and women have chosen to die for that symbolism?
I didn’t have the courage to continue. My wife, you see, was giving me dirty looks, her list not anywhere closer to being finished, the day much closer to being over.
I walked the kid down the street to talk to Mr. Anderson, who’d served in WWII. He’d explain.
Mr. Anderson’s explanations were way over my son’s head.
“Mr. Anderson,” my son finally said, “I assure you that when me and my daddy display our American flag, we will do so ceremoniously in honor of those who died for this great nation and our American way of life. And we’ll lower the flag at sundown, for we do not have satisfactory illumination.”.
Back home, as I did the chores from my wife’s honey-do list, my son asked what we were doing on Memorial Day, besides raising the flag. After Mr. Anderson’s patriotic sermon on the flag and Memorial Day, I couldn’t possibly suggest cheapening that message with swimming, barbecuing and the Indy 500.
“How about,” the boy suggested, “we go swimming, have a barbecue and watch the Indy 500 like we did last year . . . in honor of those who died for this great nation and our fun, American way of life.”.

If you and your team are bought in on the value of testing and are running experiments often, you’re probably no stranger to the hypothesis.
In other words, hypotheses are absolutely essential to getting value from every experiment you run. If you’re just getting started with A/B and multivariate testing and are looking for a guide to writing your first test hypothesis, start with this post.
Why focus on learning to create a problem-centric hypothesis? In working with customers, we’ve found that a lot of companies dive straight into conducting tests, without first having an understanding of what they want to achieve, or which problem(s) they are actually looking to solve.
The following steps will help you craft your hypotheses carefully and set you on the road to testing success.
A great hypothesis should begin with the problem, not the solution. Examine and try to understand the difficulties your visitors are experiencing, which buttons and pages are being ignored, and then think about how it can be solved. That is the substance of a winning experiment, not testing colors or placement of CTAs on a whim.
For example, are your visitors being bombarded with too many options and too little content? If the conversion rate is low, it could be because there’s too much information to be useful to the visitor on a given page. The solution could then be to remove non-critical content in order to minimize distractions and make the path to checkout or product discovery much clearer.
The next step, and arguably one of the most important, is to understand what you are looking to accomplish with your testing strategy. Is the goal to increase subscriptions, revenue, or leads? Where does your main source of revenue come from? You can’t determine strategies or tactics for testing until a goal has been decided upon.
For example, if your goal is to increase revenue for an e-commerce website, you might want to start by examining your cart checkout rate. Strategies to achieve this goal could include emphasizing the primary call-to-action (CTA), minimizing distractions in each checkout step, or building a sense of urgency for customers to complete the checkout process.
Testing tactics could then be changing messaging, removing non-critical content, and promoting temporary offers. The results of these testing tactics would all contribute to generating a better understanding of what changes can be made to increase the checkout cart rate and therefore increase revenues.
Testing requires freedom, and freedom will only come once a testing culture has been established within a company. Many of our customers have different obstacles to overcome on their journey to developing a testing culture. For instance, a financial services company we work with must have every customer experience change approved by senior staff. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are companies that have so much testing freedom that senior teams would consider changing the company’s branding if it increased conversion.
If you’re less than optimistic about how you can create a data-driven culture of testing and optimization, here’s inspiration from organizations around the world that have made the transition:.
It’s important to examine all possible areas for change, leaving no stone unturned. It is only once all possible tests have been conducted that it can be decided where the changes on the website should be made.
Most optimization programs are started with experiments that only include two variations on a single variable: red or blue, button or no button, an image with a model or without one.
However, as organizations expand the scope of their experiments and test more variables, they see dramatic improvements test performance—we recently found that testing five variations can nearly double your split testing win rate! Don’t be afraid to explore several ideas within one test to see which can generate the biggest improvement.

All six of these players now have until July 15 to let the Habs know whether or they accept the offer. Those who opt to reject the offer would then go to salary arbitration.

I ask because this is an area which you must also work on.
I swim hard through-out the year (NB I play polo so it's a bit different for me!) and include drill sessions (maybe one every two weeks) as I need them. This also depends on the volume of my bike/run training - if I am concentrating on that side more I'll do more drill sessions. This is too little IMHO (should be one a week or more) but there's not enough hours in the day...
It helps cos when you're training the next year, you can know after certain sessions that you're say, 5s off your 200m pace, so you're maybe 40s off your 1500m PB of that time last year.
So you can see two types of training on the same set but which one do you want?
Its also very easy to get tired and do 10x100m with say 30 secs rest when the first 100m took 1.30 and the last took 1.50 what are we working there?
You need to work hard on the swim!!!!!!!!
Not really sure what I should do and when so it's a bit of a hotch potch and only time will tell if it works!
Nothing wrong with doing drills in the latter part of the session its a good time and will help correct stroke problems when tired.
Take care when doing the big swims as a bad stroke will become a better bad stroke if you let it. Try allways to think and feel whats happening to the stroke even when you start to get tired.
Other ways are to break the swim down into 400 or 500 blocks with only a 15 second break for a quick drink sip and re set of your mind, and my own fav: sprint every 4th length...very hard, but if you train the same you stay the same.
I'm also anxious not to revert to my old stroke and try and 100% work on the new stuff but think this next training block before lesson 3 will be crucial and will try not to get too frustrated if things don't happen quickly!
I like the idea of a length flat out every 4 or something similar and may well give it a go tomorrow morning. This morning was my first swim post lesson 2 and think I'm getting the high elbow on recovery ok but the bent elbow in the catch/pull bit is tough for me to do somehow...I was chuffed to improve my kick drills (without board) so I can breathe and continue rather than stand up and gasp and then carry on!!
I had some swimming lessons in September and said that I would focus on my stroke until Christmas. Christmas has been and gone so I am now concentrating on speed, well how long it takes anyway. I now look at the clock when I do things (e.g 8x 50m on 1:00, 4 x 100m on 2m, 2x 200m on 4m, 1x 400m on 8m and then do the same back).
I don't like doing personal best attempts as they tend to hurt. However, I am getting quite a good feel for how hard I have to swim to get a particular time.
Saying that though, I have twice tried to see how far I can go in 30 mins. Both times, I made a deliberate attempt to swim comfortably with bilateral breating (i.e. I was going quite hard but not flat out). The first attempt at 30mins was in October, the second last Sunday. All that practice has paid off as I was 9% faster, which I was chuffed with.
My aim now is to focus on being able to keep that pace for a whole hour and then get 5% faster over the next seven months.
I I now look at the clock when I do things (e.g 8x 50m on 1:00, 4 x 100m on 2m, 2x 200m on 4m, 1x 400m on 8m and then do the same back).
The T30 swim is a standard timed swim and very usefull to see improvements on an endurance swim but I prefer to do them no more than once every 6 to 8 weeks the other long swims are never more than 500m a block but many of them.
I swam twice a week before work and ran and cycled at the weekend.
That was it, four sessions a week, so swimming really was for fitness.
Since then, you have both reviewed my technique and it does needs work.
But I have no pool time available to me where I can drill effectively.
So I have been forced to compromise on the improvements I can make.
I have worked hard to change / improve my technique by drilling / practise.
But only as part of my club’s session, not in a dedicated technique session.
So I have to accept that this is not being done in a very efficient manner.
The moral of my story is simple, compromises are a fact of my triathlon life.
I am trying to fit my training around a small family and they must come first.
I am not is a position to achieve perfection, but I can still make improvements.
I prefer to do them no more than once every 6 to 8 weeks.
Sounds good to me. I left it 3 months and I am not going to rush doing another one.
I know I have areas to improve on but I am quite proud of my technique. I have spent quite a long time (since June with the TI DVD and then swimming lessons) practising it.

RICS is a professional body that accredits professionals within the land, property and construction sectors worldwide. We regulate and promote the profession; maintain the highest educational and professional standards; protect clients and consumers via a strict code of ethics and provide impartial advice and guidance.
What's the process, cost involved and the accrued benefits to RICS accredited professional in the Real Estate and Construction segment?
To achieve MRICS, the candidate must undertake the Assessment of Professional Competence (APC). The level of assessment will depend on the candidate’s professional work experience and education.Fellow (FRICS).
All RICS members (MRICS) are eligible to apply for fellowship subject to the rules of conduct for members. Professional standards have never been more important. Clients around the world are demanding greater certainty and seeking professionals who work to the highest standards.
An RICS professional qualification demonstrates that the certified professional works to the highest standard of excellence and integrity. It also offers them a genuine competitive advantage.
Project management is the management of people, time and costs by an individual or a team to ensure the efficient commencement, progress and conclusion of a project. All these elements apply to construction projects.
Project Management Consultants manage projects by using their knowledge, skills and experience. There is a need for project management consultancy because most organisations face shortage of specialized staff and consultants can help execute projects in a short time frame.
What are the challenges and opportunities before the project proponents in India?
When the project proponent is a contractor (in the construction space):.
When the project proponent is a client of the government:.
Challenges: Government clients can face many challenges with regard to government regulations, safety laws, finance availability and multiplicity of taxes.
Opportunities: There are several opportunities for both proponents if they streamline their operations. They can get more value for their services and can have an edge over others.
We do not measure this as such but RICS accredited professionals are considered as experts in their respective fields so it does make a significant difference.
Have you done any study on how large projects are managed in India? Could you share with us some actionable insights about your findings?
We do studies from time to time but we do not share the findings unless it is a published report.
The Government of India is laying emphasis on building 100 smart cities in India. What is your take about the demand/supply scenario for project management professionals in the changing realty and infrastructure space?
It is a well-documented fact that the real estate and construction sectors face the highest shortfall in skilled professionals partly because there are not many educational institutions that offer specialised courses on real estate and construction sector. Meeting the demand for skilled professionals will be quite challenging.
Project managers in the construction industry are responsible for planning and managing building projects, such as refurbishing a house or building a skyscraper. Their responsibilities include design, procurement, planning authorities, budget, contractors, clients, change, the lifecycle of the project, document management and other areas, to ensure that the construction project reaches a desired conclusion.
The trends in project management are across verticals such as people and IT systems, machinery/equipment.
People: Organisations are looking for people with project control skills, value engineering skills, and use of alternate sustainable materials, multi-disciplinary approach and knowledge.
IT systems: Knowledge of IT systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning, project management software such as Candy, Primavera, use of computer systems such as Geographic Information System, 3D/5D modelling, virtual walkthroughs and holographics.
What kind of future do you see for RICS in India?
We see a steady demand for RICS professional chartered qualification (MRICS) going forward. In the last eight years, the total number of applicants for chartered qualification has reached 30,000 with close to 3,000 chartered members and trainees operating in the region.

According to government figures, PPPs in the UK have delivered £56 billion of private sector capital investment in over 700 UK infrastructure projects around the UK. The range of different projects that can potentially come under the PPP remit includes schools and housing, university student accommodation, defence projects, waste management, border control, street lighting, energy projects (including solar), as well as transport infrastructure and healthcare.
PPPs are designed to use private sector businesses to bring projects to life in the UK that might not otherwise make it off the drawing board and to deliver better value for taxpayers than pure public funding alone. Some PPPs have not achieved this and they have provoked fierce discussion as a result – however there are also some great examples of PPPs all over the world that demonstrate what can be achieved with public and private collaboration.
In the UK, the first ever PPP contract signed to design, build, and finance and operate a 1,000-bed hospital in Norwich was signed in 1996. The hospital was completed five months ahead of schedule and came in on budget.
In the US, one of the biggest and most high profile examples of a successful PPP project was the $3.91bn deal to build a terminal at New York’s LaGuardia Airport.
In Bangladesh, a Health sector PPP initiative was responsible for upgrading and running a total of 60 haemodialysis machines in two public hospitals to help the 400,000 diagnosed with kidney-related diseases every year in Bangladesh.
In Pakistan, renewable energy PPP projects have enabled the government to bridge the country’s the gap in energy deficiency and help to reduce the pressure on deteriorating balance of payment conditions due to massive oil import bill.
There are three major types of PPPs currently in use:.
Concession contract PPPs. This type of PPP brings in a private sector business to provide a concession on behalf of a public authority. The most obvious example of this would be something like a toll motorway.
Institutional/Joint Venture PPPs. Although previously not as widely used, this type of PPP is becoming increasingly popular. It involves the creation of a joint venture between a private business and a public authority with responsibilities and benefits on both sides of the agreement.
What are the benefits and advantages of PPP projects?
Diversifying the funding sources that are available. The evolution of PPPs is increasingly providing a much wider range of equity and debt financing that can be channeled into improvements to the infrastructure and services that the public enjoys. Without the PPP vehicle this kind of financing would simply not be an option for public infrastructure projects.
Swifter completion. While there are plenty of examples of PPPs that have run into trouble with delays etc, when a project like this runs smoothly it is an efficient and swift way to deliver construction that could otherwise take double the time. This is particularly important where the project involves urgently required infrastructure, whether that’s transport for commuters or healthcare for a desperately sick demographic.
Local authorities are cash poor in the UK – particularly at the current time – and so public infrastructure housing projects are often stalled or simply never launched. There may also be substantial red tape involved in the launch of construction that is to be purely publicly funded and this can cause a lot of delays. PPP projects in the housing sector can help to solve both of these major issues, introducing value for money, up front capital, as well as the opportunity to deliver projects more quickly to try to catch up with ever-increasing housing demand.
Enabling funding for a much wider range of housing projects.
Many people believe that it is innovation in construction that will deliver a solution to the housing shortage – not something that is frequently found in publicly funded projects. PPP has the potential to diversify the range of different projects that can be launched because of the shared risk. From rent-to-buy through to new and innovative affordable public housing schemes, a partnership between forward thinking private interests and public authorities looking for housing solutions could generate many more options.
There are many private sector bodies available to enable PPP housing infrastructure projects, from volume house builders through to housing associations, co-operative housing and community land trusts. So, PPPs provide access to resources, expertise and innovation – as well as investment – on a much broader scale. This offers the opportunity for housing sector collaborations to genuinely add value in a way that a purely publicly funded team may not be able to do.
The future of PPPs has to begin with the mistakes of the past.
The reality for infrastructure projects is that, if you remove PPPs from the picture altogether, rates of project completion slow down and the number of projects that are possible drops significantly. The issue of lack of resources remains, no matter what industry or public opinion says about PPPs – and these public private collaborations are (with some tweaks to the model) the most obvious way to overcome that obstacle.
PPPs have a lot to offer the construction world and, with a new approach, could be more effective than ever.

I talked to her about what it takes to break in as an outdoor freelance writer. [This interview was done in late 2017, when Abby was still a senior editor at REI's Adventure Projects.].
To what extent do you work with freelancers?
For REI, we use almost all freelancers and it's all paid. The rates we pay vary dramatically based on previous experience, the length of the piece, whether you providing photos, all of those factors play a role in a rate.
For the REI online presence, we are creating content about cool people doing cool things outdoors. Where to go to recreate, conservation efforts, some news, gear, it’s really cross spectrum. Some of the stuff we do write ourselves, but I spend 90% of my days editing and assigning.
It’s the freelancer’s job to get to really know the publication, know what we are looking for, and then bring an idea to me. A fresh idea. .
Looking at it from the editor's side, what do you see as the most common mistake that freelancers make when they trying to pitch you on REI or Outside?
1. BRING AN IDEA, NOT A QUESTION.
Another common mistake is sending short or two sentence pitches. About 20% of pitches I get are like that. “Oh, I want to write about my cool bike hiking trip”. Sell this to me! Why? Why would I want to pay you for this?
Once you’ve accepted a pitch from a freelancer, what are the mistakes that make it unusable for publication?
One source is not enough. Give me more, give me variety. Even if it's a quick roundup you feel you can knock-out in an hour, do don't it like that! Make some phone calls, talk to some people and bring me the exports. Bring me a properly reported piece.
Four ways to stand out from the pack.
What can a freelancer do to stand out from the pack, and to make themselves more useful to you?
Send a really thoughtful pitch email. That’s awesome, that’s everything.
Explaining not only the idea of the story but also the format is also super helpful.
Is this going to appear as profile or q&a?
You don't have to break down every single thing, but just give me a rough idea of what will it look like. Those things stand out to me.
I understand that it's hard and not everyone is a photographer. I'm a very poor photographer myself. But, unfortunately, we live and work in a time when the media industry is not necessary striving, financially speaking, so most places have really small budgets.
Networking matters! It really is about who you know in this industry..
How realistic is it to make a living as a freelance outdoor writer now?
There is money out there! If you hustle hard and you are good at what you do, if you can throw a pitch and network well, I think it's very possible to make a living. Networking matters! It really is about who you know in this industry.
For somebody who starting out, who does not know anybody very much, what are the ways to get to know people?
Twitter is a great place to start. I also get a lot of freelancers there.
24 Ways to get More Followers on Twitter ].
A professor said years and years ago that you should always be kind to everyone around you who is younger, because eventually they may be your boss! That stayed with me.
I get a lot of emails from young people starting out, asking if we can have a phone call or grab coffee. I'm really busy and sometimes it is hard to make time for that but I am really do try to do it. I had some great people who mentored me in this industry, so I'm trying to be that person to anyone who reaches out.
So reach out the editor or the writer who you read a lot, who you admire. Send them a note! Say what you like about their latest article and ask them questions, if they are open to it.
As long as things are still well reported, I'm usually okay with it. But it has to be well reported. It can't just be someone going on a press trip speaking so highly about a hotel that they stayed in. That won't fly with me.
At REI, I would say a handful a day. But we are a small team, we don't publish a handful a day. I definitely can't accept them all. Outside receives far, far more, just because it's been around for 40 years.
The type varies but what they all have in common is an enticing headline and deck. I worked at a Huffington Post for a little while and learned so much about content that goes viral and what makes it viral. It's sort of an art and a science.
If you want people to click on it, there has to be a reason. There needs to be some kind of cliff hanger. For instance, I’ve noticed that when people publish on Facebook, they give everything away in the status. And why would I click if I saw everything?
So, if you have a round-up, you give a sneak peek. You’ll see a lot of “myth number three” or whatever, but it really works, people end up sharing it.
For those attention grabbing headlines, does it help if a freelancer has an idea for you?
I love it when freelancers suggest them. I don't necessarily roll with everything every time, but there is no harm in giving me some ideas and options.
You studied journalism, you started out as a writer, and you've effectively transitioned in being an editor. Why did you move from the one space to another?
I think that having as much experience in as many areas of the business as possible is really beneficial. You always learning and it's interesting. Plus my writing has gotten so much better now when I'm on another side because I can put myself in my own shoes. I can ask myself whether I would accept this pitch or would I ask for a better lead. It allowed me to see from the editor's perspective.
You've been active in a journalism space for about 10 years. What changes have you seen in the market in that time?
One big change is that as technology has evolved we've started to see interesting multi-media packages. Like that New York Times article - Snow Fall: The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek. It was beautifully put together.
Also the podcast boom has happened in the last five years and now everyone is wanting to make a podcast. It's fun, reviving the radio days and that's very cool.
Unfortunately we've seen a lot of traditional print magazines fold. Now it’s not as frequent that the company as a whole folds, but we are print publications close and move everything online. Which to me emphasises that this is shifting and evolving, not dying.
Any predictions about the next 10 years?
This might be inaccurate but I think that we will continue to see more of the tech and development side of things blend with editorials. Ten years ago I was not talking to the dev team, the coders behind everything. Now I run with a dev dude the designer dude from Outside all the time.
I see this continued mix of audio and video, photo and cool special effects with words. Which is cool, I think. Bigger team!
Breaking in is about trying to meet the people who run this industry..
Engage with outdoor writers, editors and photographers as much as possible. Athletes even, if you can.
Breaking in is about trying to meet the people who run this industry, who participate in this industry. We come back to Twitter networking and sending emails to writers and editors... I think it's the best way to break in.
She's the founder of Sticks & Stones, a newsletter about the outdoors, women's issues, and badass women doing outdoorsy things.

Helping to make matters more intense, extended insufficient sleep creates over production of cortisol. Cortisol in it’s right amount may help us to sense some tension and urgency to get things done. However when it’s overproduced, it causes us to feel stressed, anxious, as well as uneasy continually. This might lead to even deeper medical challenges of anxiety and depression. Not surprisingly, sleep loss is harmful for any individuals.

Five Things That Shouldn’t Go Wrong On Your Birthday:.

“Knowing that it was kind of a tryout session because I didn’t have anything else after that.
“Now, knowing that for sure I’m racing all year long, my name is on the car this time and it’s my guys and my team. So, I’m excited about that. I think that just helps out the confidence level so much.
It’s a full plate for Wallace, who is in a super tight Sunoco Rookie of the Year battle with 20-year old Hendrick Motorsports driver William Byron. And it’s been an emotional learning curve at times – right from the green flag of the season-opening Daytona 500, NASCAR’s biggest race of the year.
Wallace, 24, finished runner-up in his Daytona 500 debut, setting the stage for what he expected to be a solid year. However, that amazing start forced him to remind himself at times that this was still a learning situation of many first-time this-and-that’s. The races were longer, the season was longer and the competition level was top-notch – he was in the big leagues now. And it is a different game.
To be fair, even veteran drivers have been scratching their heads, considering the 13-race season has been dominated by Ford’s Kevin Harvick, who has five wins and Toyota’s Kyle Busch, who has four. Outside of those two drivers, each team feels a certain urgent need to catch-on and catch-up.
“We’re still trying to figure out some things on that forefront,” Wallace allowed. “I think from the OEM standpoint as well, we all see it as a big picture. We need to step it up, for sure.
“Looking back, last weekend was a solid weekend for us,” Wallace said. “It’s little things that are taking our program to the next level. Focusing in on races like that is what we need to do. It was a decent points day for us, and we are closing up on some guys in front of us.
“We still have a lot of work to do to get inside the top 16, but I’m looking forward to kind of shifting gears and getting to the high gear here for the second part of the season and make that final push.”.

Releasing software isn’t an art, but it is an engineering discipline. Continuous Deployment can be thought of as an extension to Continuous Integration which makes us catch defects earlier.
In this blog on Continuous Deployment, you will go through the following topics:.
Now, often people get confused between the terms, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment. So let me clarify the confusion for you!
Continuous Delivery does not involve deployment to production on every change that occurs. You just need to ensure that the code is always in a deployable state, so you can deploy it easily whenever you want.
On the other hand, Continuous Deployment requires every change to be deployed automatically, without human intervention.
So, as you can see in the diagram once Continuous Integration stages are completed, the newly built application is automatically deployed to production then it is Continuous Deployment. On the other hand, if we manage to automate everything, but decide to require a human approval in order to proceed with the deployment of the new version, then we are taking into account Continuous Delivery. Well, the difference is very much subtle, but it has enormous implications, making each technique appropriate for various situations.
So, now that you have an understanding of Continuous Deployment, let’s see a case study on Continuous Deployment.
The system included various branches diverging from a single trunk developed in a parallel manner. So, a developer would write big batches of code with respect to various features and then wait for this feature branch to be merged into the trunk i.e. the master branch.
Once the feature was merged into the master branch, it had to be again tested to make sure that it did not break into any other code of a different feature at the same instance.
Since this system included several batches of code written in isolation by various teams, and then once written are merged into a single branch, this system was known as a feature branch system. This kind of system limited the scope and number of features, thus slowing down the company’s development life cycle.
Once the code passes the tests it is merged into trunk and listed out in a system that shows managers what features are ready to go live on the site or in newer versions of LinkedIn’s apps.
Now, let me continue this discussion by telling you the basic benefits of Continuous Deployment.
The benefits that Continuous Deployment offers are as follows:.
Solution: Follow the steps below to deploy the application in a headless mode.
Step 2: Once you create your maven project, include the code of Selenium App in the main Java file and make sure you have inserted the argument to deploy it in the headless mode.
Step 3: After that include the required dependencies in the pom.xml file.
Step 4: After this, your project is ready to run. Since we want to run it in headless mode, we have to deploy this application in the Jenkins Server.
Step 7.1: To do that, go to the Repositories tab and choose the option New.
Step 7.2: After that mention the repository name, and choose if you wish your project to be private or public and then finally click on Create Repository.
Step 8: To push your project to this repository. Follow the below steps:.
Step 8.3: Once you are done with that, commit the operation using the command git commit -m ‘Type in your message here’.
Step 9: Once the JAR file has been pushed to the local repository, you have to create a new Job in the Jenkins server. To do that, open your Jenkins Dashboard, and then go to New Item -> Type in the item name -> Click on OK.
Step 10: Once your job is created, click on the job and go to configure option.
Step 10.3: Once you’re done with the above two steps, save the changes.
Step 11: Click on Build Now, to build the project and see the output.
Since it is continuous deployment, that is the case where this program can be deployed by any person working in the team and the others can only see the output that something has been, changed. They will not know who has deployed it directly onto the production servers.

Nitra then. First time here, but we have good memories from other cities in Slovakia in the past so we expect the best. Concert went well, the new bass amp from Warsaw seem to hold up, and we continued the evening in Polish tradition also in Slovakia. Positive thing about these places is that you can bring your own (usually home-made) drinks to the clubs, something of course many trve DEMONICAL fans does (and of course want us to drink of - yummie).
After a steady warm-up in Baltikum and Poland, the tour finally starts flowing for real. After Club Naozzay closed, we were shown to some other place in the city. The street ladies outside made us think we walked into a bordel, but it turned out to be a hard rock club in there, many people from the concert was there too. A rough estimation of 100% of the people here would have been thrown out of any ordinary bar in Stockholm (bartenders included).
Johan Volturyon decided that it was a good idea to bring his computer to the after party; needless to say he has no computer no more (and possibly no job).
Some time after 06:00 it was time to go back to the bus. A mob of 7-8 people waited for us outside to "beat long hair guys"; luckily Pablo the Ruthless scared them away on his own. The last persons managed to get on the tour bus around 10 minutes pre last call.
Needless to say, we can't find anywhere to eat properly on this route. Finally in Cluj in the evening, the bus looks worse than ever. Janne is watching a documentary on her computer about people with some kind of braindisorder, making them unlable to clean their homes. The homes filmed looks quite a lot neater than our tour bus now.
At our entrance they started playing some songs from our last album, making us feel welcomed. We also learn from some people that "hadderajan" in romanian means "train going off track". Actually makes sense.
The best conversation of the evening sounded something like this:.
Fredrik: "Maybe we wanna stay, what then? How are you gonna throw this guy out?" (Fredrik looking at Sverker) "He is like two times as big as you are.".
Fredrik: "The best thing is that you are not even joking.".
We decided to leave the Hard Cafe when they wanted to close.

Item 4 is one I've seen elsewhere: https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Ink-Practical-Building-Reso...
In fact, I recall a Pixar writer said it was one of his favorite books.
Actually, I found it (same blog):.
Apparently the author claims neither he nor Pixar came up with it.

If your hen isn’t the type of girl to paint the town red, opt for the ultimate girl’s night in and have a full scale pyjama party. Order pizza, get a selection of chick flicks, do makeovers and face masks, paint your nails, and pass around plenty of bubbly, strawberries and chocolate.
If the party will be in the hen’s home town, book onto a local tour, and have guests tell stories about the hen that relate to different local landmarks or areas. Talk to old friends beforehand to make sure there are plenty of good tales to tell, and hopefully some photos to pass around. Make sure you keep the stories fairly clean if you’re inviting her future mother-in-law along.
An arts and crafts hen party is a great choice for a sedate group, and you can combine it with making bombonieres, stationery, or wedding decorations. You could even hold a flower arranging lesson where the bride could learn to create her own wedding table centrepieces.
Food and drink based activities always work well at hen’s parties, whether you learn how to mix a killer cocktail, or to make delicious chocolates. Have a chef demonstrate cooking an entire meal and then eat it, or spend the evening cooking and icing a variety of cupcakes to pile up and create a novelty wedding cake.
If your hen craves an elegant sophisticated hen party, but your guests can’t afford a top notch dinner, consider having high tea in a classy hotel instead. A set high tea will be cheaper than a full dinner, but just as fun and filling, and you’ll have plenty of time for cocktails afterwards.

I’ve thought a lot about how you develop your own style of parenting, and how you become comfortable in your parenting skin.
These days I’m much more relaxed about how much sugar my children consume, I totally embrace co-sleeping and I feel less guilty when I flick on the TV to get ready for work in the morning.
But then my daughter started primary school, and I realise I have sorted nothing.
Primary school has its own set of expectations to navigate.
Now my daughter is in her second year of primary school, I realise that I have a whole new level of parenting heights to scale.
By now I should know that comparing yourself to other families is a sure-fire path to misery. And still I do it. Here are a few of the areas where I judge myself against other parents.
Other kids are doing ballet, music and languages. Darcy used to do swimming lessons, and then she learnt to swim. So we stopped. No other activities followed for a number of reasons.
Still. Every so often I get twinges that she should be doing more.
Then I hear other parents talk about how they sit with their children and go through spelling, maths and maybe even science. And I think. I’m not supporting her enough, she needs more discipline. I need more discipline.
I know it’s important to be involved in school life. Whether that’s volunteering in a reading group or getting along to an assembly here or there. And while I always make a big effort for the end of year concert, my contribution to the school is limited by my working hours.
It’s not just a sense of obligation that makes me feel wanting in this respect. I’ve seen the look on Darcy’s face when I’m at school with her- not just to pick her up or drop her off. She lights up and she’s excited that I’m there.
I also miss out on getting to know the other parents and forming a community with other adults who are going through similar experiences with their kids.
Last year at the Book Week parade, one mother had dressed her two children as the snail and the whale (from the Julia Donaldson book of the same name). The costumes were spectacular, and they were made by hand.
When I go to parent-teacher night I’m nervous, like we’re about to talk about my parenting failures (not how Darcy is going at school).
Sitting across from her teacher (who is lovely, by the way) I’m thinking – does she know how bad we are with homework? She certainly knows I don’t volunteer, does she think I’m a bad parent?
It doesn’t help that I’m perched on a tiny chair, in front of a tiny desk, with the paraphernalia of school activities all around me. Even though logically I know we are peers, there’s a part of me that feels like I’m back at school.
Talk about performance anxiety.
I am quite sure I could have spared myself some of the worry I had over things like sugar, co-sleeping and screen time when my children were younger, now that I look back from the comfortable place of the present.
And while it’s a simple question with a simple answer, it should be enough to blow away all the anxieties that I’m failing as a parent.
But unless I stop my own propensity to compare myself with others, each part of this parenting journey is going to be plagued with anxiety.

What to Think About When You're 7 Months Pregnant.
Lying back, you look down at your stomach and see what appears to be an alien trying to claw its way out. Don't freak out—that's just your bundle of joy doing gymnastics.
If you're currently near or around the seven month mark during pregnancy, you're definitely showing. Maybe your walking style has turned into something resembling a penguin's waddle, or back pains and swollen ankles are becoming a daily part of your life. It also may seem as if you've been pregnant forever—though it's only actually been seven months. Also, bear in mind that the next and last two months will also seem as if they'll go on forever. But it won't.
This article will address two key things you can do now at the seven month mark of your pregnancy cycle.
How to start thinking about your birth plan.
This will not only help pass the time, but will better prepare you for when your little bundle of joy does arrive. Good luck and hang in there!
How to Think About Your Birth Plan.
At seven months, you should definitely start thinking about your birth plan. You can discuss your options with friends, midwives, other mothers, or your OB. This is a great idea, seeing as how they might come up with ideas about things you've never thought about.
Who do you want in the room with you during the birth?
What pain relief method would you prefer? (Research can be done to explore the many options that are available.).
Would you like your partner present if you must have a Cesarean?
Would you like a mirror available so that you can see the baby being delivered? (Some hospitals provide these.).
Another thing you can do is begin to plan or pack your hospital bag. Try to approach this like you're packing for camp. In other words, pack anything and everything you think you may need.
It is a good idea to get this bag packed early, rather than wait until the due date. You never know exactly when the baby will come, unless you have a scheduled induction. Here is a list of suggested items to pack in your bag. Keep in mind that these are only suggestions.
Books and crossword puzzles to pass the time.
Change for the pay phone in case the phone in your room is tied up.
Your phone charger in case you are there for a while.
A list of phone numbers of people you wish to notify afterward.
Remember, this should be a joyful and very exciting time in your life. As ready as you are to give birth, remember that after birth you may still crave the closeness that you and your baby once had. So, for now enjoy every moment!

i am seve months pregnant ,this is my first pregnancy i cant wait to hold my little prince.

7 months! I've enjoyed my pregnancy so much, this has been a great 180 on my life. I'm blessed this love bug will soon be here.
When i employed to receive high on lifestyle although lately We've built up the level of resistance.
kim and alex are nothing but low lives before you judge a book look at yourselves first no one is perfect and by the way karma is a bitch..
I am 7 months pregnant, with a bouncing baby girl. Very excited and can't wait for her to introduce herself to this world! But I will not want or have my child around anyone who believes in belittling others. It clearly shows how there child will be raised. I'm sure your parent once told you if "If you have nothing nice to say than don't say anything at all" plain in simple this is for expecting mothers to share there thoughts with others not to bring down women!!! News Flash to all you who think Kim was right -__-.
I'm 7 months pregnant, can I still get an abortion?
well im 7 months pregnant and my baby is sitting very oddly in my stomach.. almost like shes sitting up in my right side. im not sure if this is normal but im kindve scared.. anyone know what's going on?
Biancia didn't post anything to have to do with the way she TYPED! We can type anyway we want. How about helping her with her pregnancy, and letting her know it will be okay. I'm only 17 and have more respect for people than most of these ladies do.
& I'm 7 months! Can't wait for my baby boy!
oops i mean kim not kia oh well your name isn't very important to me anyways but i don't want you thinking i can't spell either, you might give me an (F) for spelling your name wrong since you a wanna be teacher!!!
Anyone being negative should have had an abortion.. Being a mom is a beautiful thing.. Thank god your still pregnant because some women aren't as lucky. Bashing anyone is sad and being that it was posted 2 years ago all u unhappy women need to look within yourselves and find happiness because your obviously miserable. And those looking for an argument are lonely.. That is all.! Good Luck To All The Happy Moms..
Lol. Completely agree with Kim. Before you bring a child in this world I hope you work on yourself first. Perhaps pick up something called a "book".... Maybe learn how to read and write something called ENGLISH correctly is something not only you but your BABY would benefit from. Anyone can get pregnant and have a child. Ignorance is here to stay people :/.
Wow I thought we're shuring experience with being pregnat not how rude and disrespectfull we could be to one another. Kim if u don't have anything nice to say than u shouldn't say anything at all we learn that as kids. Just because she had some typos doesn't mean she is dumb but u shure did show us your ignorance.
So excited I have a 4 year old son and 7 months pregnant with a Girl..it has been different from when I was pregnant with my.
let's focus on what's best for the newborn babies and welcome the new generation.
im so scared because this is my first kid and im 18 and all my babys dady wants to do is be with other women and its like he dose not care about the baby he just cares about himself i don't have a clue on what to do or say to him ??????????????
I am 28 weeeks and can't wait to have my baby. He will be my first born and i am so excited. i will give him all the love i never had in my life. Anyone out there tired of sleeping on their sides?
Ppl get under my skin at times. to have read all these comment you ladies should be ashamed of yourselves for downing her on her spelling. i do the same thing at times when i don't have much time to type. im 7 months and so ready to have my lil girl. god bless you all and good luck :).
I'll be 7 months on Tuesday with my little girl Grace Anna Lynn(: I'm due on April 20th and I just can't wait until she gets here. The back pains are starting to get worse and the hips. Unfortunately, her father didn't stick around.. But I'm going to do everything in my power for her. She's already my world! Good luck everyone, hope all goes well!
Iv come on this page to see what my baby looks like now, well iv got 9 weeks left, and the comments have killed my mood, have i entered English class? not being funny but do you not think its more dumb too degrade some one over how people spell lol were all here for the same thing so why kill the mood.....thanks a lot. I mean if i had any complaint about pregnant women it would be against the ones who keep spitting out children they dont even give a shit about but that's just my opinion, it doesent matter weather ur fat slim educated uneducated and shit, all that matters is if you're going to be a good mother to you're child so W.E.
I am 7 months pregnant with my first and it's a girl! I thank God for everything - this little girl changed my life for the better. My husband and I are so happy together, even with my hormones swinging around! Life is truly beautiful when you have children.
i am 7 months pregnant with ma first child am so excited till i see him thank u god 4 your special gift.
It's so wonderful to see all u pregnant women happy during your pregnancy... I'm going.thru a lot. My son who is now 5 yrs old never put me thru so much.
Well some ppl get angry when they see how some people type... I mean, if your going to say something or spell something, itd might as well b right...right? why do it the wrong way.
11 years later, im having a girl! Excited and nervous. 8).
WELL I HAVE READ A LOT OF THESE COMMENTS,AND AS I AM GOING TO BE A NANNA FOR THE FIRST TIME BY MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER, I FEEL ALL OF YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN AND BE GRATEFUL FOR THE JOY OF BEING PREGNANT.
IT IS ALL VERY FRIGHTENING AND OF COURSE BEING ABLE TO SPELL OR NOT DOESN'T GIVE ANY OF YOU THE RIGHT TO MAKE JUDGEMENT ON THIS LADY.
GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE A HEART AND THAT MAGIC WORD UNDERSTANDING////.
Who has the time to sit and correct other people.. if that bitch kim was more focused on her CHILD then she wouldn't have time to try and correct peoples errors. good way to talk shit behind a computer screen because your bitch ass would have been slapped saying it to someones face. miserable ignorant bitch..i bet your sitting behind the computer eating a big fat bowl of icecream and about 300 lbs haha..or you may be a plastic surgery blonde thinking about the next surgery to take out on your ugly face.
First of all im from the virgin islands and that's the way we speak. Its called an accent kim. Its so funny how people always have negative things to say any ways about PREGNANCY!!!! I am 7 months as well and am so anxious about meeting my baby girl. I can't wait to see her. Instead of drama can someone give me advice about what to do to calm my self down and pass time by. Thank you.
just let any one know the way biancia is speaking is not a typo it call slang texting so the one who spoke first (KIM)know what you talking about first before you start being rude: but anyway i had to say something it made me upset, but to the ladies who are expecting good lucky on your new born baby. :).
I'm 7 months pregnant and loving every movement my baby boy makes. 2 more months and he'll be in my arms (:.
Loving my pregnancy almost due can't wait to see my baby boy.
Yes there are some very strange women out there, scary thing is that they are pregnant these spiteful women and they are going to raise the children of our future, futures not lookin so bright with retarded parents !
Its very Sad To read All the negative Comments On what is Supposed To be a beautiful Website....Comes To show Why Some Woman Choose Pro Choice, I pity Your children- Because You have Nothing better To do In your Lives then Argue with people You Don't even know...This Conversation started 7 months ago... Very sad.
wow this is amazing how a site about pregnancy and concerns turns into something so ugly :( people need to focus more on helping these pregnant women out because I'm pregnant myself and it's not easy! it's very stressful and adding useless comments to someone else's post....well why are you even on here? yes I'm 7 months today :)! and at times it's really hard and painful but I'll be glad when my little Zack gets here :).
Stick to kind words :-). We all have been blessed by our higher power!!! Congrats to all of us. We should all be the best people we can be so we can teach our children that as well.
Hello, don't think this is a site for bashing let the girl speak the way she wants and lets focus on pregnancy, not highschool bullying skills.
I hope everyone is blessed with beautiful babbies and I wish everyone the best.
i think everyone on here is just pregnant and bitchy!!! haha judging each other and fighting about something that is literally of NO significance whatsoever is just a symptom of being 7 months pregnant.
im 20, about 5'3 pretty petite, i don't know if it's just my small-ish frame or what?!
i am 28 weeks, so excited can't wait to hold my girl.
Being pregnant is one of the happiest thing that have ever happened to me especially when the baby is quickning. No body is above mistake. Congrats to all mothers to be.
It's quite amazing how are society is treating each other as women and mother's. Give respect and love another as you want to be loved back. Where's your morality "GIRLS"? To all the Mommy's to be and Mothers; God speed and congrats!
As I am 30 almost 31 weeks on Friday with my first baby boy. I am right there with this young lady who had her baby and posted the first comment. You do not know what to expect or feeling or have pre-automated instructions programed into you. So wise up and quit cyber bullying!
And using the lang. y'all do is horrible. I hope y'all don't curse around ya'lls "bundle of joy" when they come...
P.S 28 weeks & can't wait to have her!!
Im 28 weeks today. With my 3rd baby. Finally IT'S A GIRL. Its not bad giving birth. I had my previous 2 with no pain meds. But i just depends on how well you handle pain. If you don't know when you will be in labor it feel like cramps. Its a very beautiful thing. I wish all you ladies well. Congrats on you all little bundle of joy. God bless.
I am 28 weeks, and can't wait to have my little boy. He is already very active and like to move when I move. Just imagining taking him fishing or playing basketball with him in a few years make me smile, and all of his firsts. Ugh these last 3 months need to hurry up and pass.
I'm 31 wks today and I'm soO excited to see my little girl and finally hold her ^_^!! My biggest fear is giving birth =( I honestly dread it!! Anyone else out there feel the same way?? =/.
I am 7months i am so HAPPY that i made it this FAR from the blessing from god for giving me this child and hope that its blessed with everything nerves and excited at the same time can't wait to hold my BABY BOY can't wait till he is here with me...
Besides, her name isn't Bianca it is Biancia lol oh i am sorry i mean laugh out loud, wouldn't want any one to think i am uneducated or stupid -_-.

So how do you build a super successful travel homeworking business when you have no customers?
And secondly, you need to look very carefully into how that travel homeworking company manages the relationship between customers and their homeworkers.
The way we work at Holidaysplease is completely different! Our ethos is all about building the relationship between the customer and their homeworker from the start and then repeatedly.
Travel agents working in retail stores often worry about slow sales in November and December every year.
With Holidaysplease you don’t need to worry!
Andrea joined the Holidaysplease Team around 6 years ago and has grown into one of our most consistent high performers.
Virtual reality, artificial intelligence, robots can all now be found in retail travel, call-centres and airports enhancing the customer experience via inspiration and improved efficiency.
That means truly outstanding personal service and knowledge from the very first interaction a travel sales person has with a customer, through the sales process to pre and post departure and beyond.
The robotic restaurant is a reality. Can I envisage a robotic travel agency built around artificial intelligence, 100% I can! It will succeed because it will be quick and cheap due to efficiency savings and of course no staff salaries.
New travel homeworking enquiries have been coming in thick and fast the result of which is some great people lined up to join the award winning Holidaysplease Homeworking Team over the next few weeks.
We’ve also had to let down a few people. Why? Well firstly we are fussy. You don’t achieve the Trustpilot customer services ratings we do at Holidaysplease without a great deal of commitment and expertise from our homeworking team. We cannot afford to take on anything but the best.
And secondly, we recruit responsibly. The easy option for us would be to sell the dream and paint an irresistible picture of homeworking being a land filled with milk and honey where the sales just flow in and commission is easily earned.
Yes, over time by doing the right things consistently well and working with real commitment you can build an amazing homeworking business with Holidaysplease, and many of our team have done so. But it is no easy ride.
If we are not sure that someone can achieve what they want as a Travel Homeworker with Holidaysplease then it would be irresponsible for us to take them on board.
I’m sure there were a multitude of reasons why the judges chose Holidaysplease 😉.
Announcing Holidaysplease as the winner Mike from Fred Olsen made particular reference to the close relationship we have with our team and the things we do as a company to look after and develop our people at HQ and our homeworkers.
Mike also highlighted the work we have done on our email marketing as part of our unique customer rewards programme which over 10,000 customers have now signed up to.
Each of these customers receives a regular communication from us which is individually tailored to the holiday likes and preferences they have shared with us.
There are two key reasons for this :-.
1) As the holidays we sell are mainly to long haul destinations with an average selling price close to £5,000 our customers tend to plan and book well ahead.
2) Via our thousands of effective online marketing campaigns generating new customers and the consistent smart marketing we do with our existing customer base, we create opportunities for the Holidaysplease Homeworkers to make sales pretty much every day, week and month of the year.
And there is the third, and perhaps most critical element. Attitude.
For every travel homeworker attitude is the real key to the door. Set high goals and believe you can achieve them and you just might do exactly that. Take the easy option and settle for second best and guess what, second is where you will end up.
So believing that we can create opportunities every day that can lead to a sale is engrained in the Holidaysplease culture and attitude.
Too many people in travel get switched on and busy for peaks or lates, then pretty much go quiet for the rest of the year believing that it is only in peaks or lates that customers want to buy. Wrong attitude!
If you are a can do travel expert hungry for a Travel Homeworking Opportunity with a partner that is switched on for 12 months of the year rather than 4, then we’d love to hear from you.
At Holidaysplease we don’t do peaks and troughs. We do consistent effort matched with a firm belief that our goals are there to be reached.
Every successful Travel Homeworker will be self-motivated and super determined. They will be an action taker happy to rely upon themselves rather than others to get the job done.
At the same time they will value knowing that support is there when they need it.
Which is why we continue to invest in the Travel Homeworking support we give to the Holidaysplease Homeworking Team.
Last year our twin pillars of support became three when Michelle joined. Her energy and knowledge has proved invaluable to the team over the last 9 months.
We have always strived to provide not just support, but quality support. Our Holidaysplease Sales Team Leaders do not wait for our team to need them, they are pro-actively in touch with the team on a regular basis.
The leaders help with day to day issues, as well as addressing big picture challenges, and helping the Holidaysplease Homeworkers develop and grow their businesses.
To do this well, our Leaders need to constantly evolve and develop new skills of their own. Which is why our three Sales Team Leaders plus Natalie, our Head Office Team Leader, are currently in the middle of a 15-month Leadership Developing training programme developed by Reality Training.
The investment in the training programme is a significant one, and the demands that it places on our leaders are heavy. Still, the new skills and techniques being developed and learned will ensure that as a business Holidaysplease continues to provide the very best Travel Homeworking support to our team of homeworkers.
Every time the Olympics come around I am reminded of how powerful a motivator having a dream can be. For some the dream is just to become an Olympian, for those at the very top of their sports only a medal, often a Gold one, will do.
Her sales exceeded £250,000 for the month and the commission earned on those sales was greater than what the majority of travel sales people will earn in a year!
My highlight has to be my booking with £20k in commission, and of course hitting my £1million in sales for the year!
For me starting out as a travel homeworker and being able to work from home as my children go through school, watch their sports days and school achievement assemblies without having to ask a boss for the time off. I have always loved working in the travel industry and to be selling holidays from my own home with no limit to my earnings is like living the dream.
Earning the extra income has allowed me to spoil my family at Christmas and hire a cleaner!
One of my main highlights was an Hawaiian trip for some local customers. He was a huge volcano fan and really wanted to see one up close. We started off with a £6k budget and I ended up booking them a trip of a lifetime for over £14k! This was their letter in our local magazine :-.
As advertising managers for the Village Voice I thought I would let you know about the excellent experience we have recently had with one of your advertisers.
My highlight would have to be hitting my record £78k month while being on holiday and only working half the month! Dragging in the final £12k booking whilst relaxing in a huge pool villa by the sea!
There are so many highlights this year! I think the one that stands out is a client who had arranged a total surprise wedding at the Rendezvous on her birthday after being together for 25 years.
I have a few highlights this year. Getting my Gold Award for sales having been silver twice in a row. I was really proud to finally get there, all the hard work paid off.
I had my best sales month ever in February booking over £100k.
I was lucky enough to go on two amazing FAM trips to Australia and Mauritius. And this years Conference in Portugal was a fantastic couple of days with great Suppliers and brilliant to catch up with old friends I now have after 5 years with Holidaysplease and make new ones.
Also my repeat customers, people who had previously booked once before that are re-booking. For me this is huge, it reinforces that they are happy with what I’m doing so will not only re-book but recommend me.
Homeworking with Holidaysplease is honestly the best decision I have ever made! I am over the moon with the amount of my customers booking and stunned by the amount of money I have been earning doubling my previous shop managers salary in one month and not even feeling the slightest bit stressed!
Keen to join in the fun? Our recruitment team Gemma and Agne are ready to chat with you on 0121 200 5705 or email gemma.mcleod@holidaysplease.com or agne@holidaysplease.com.

LADY T.: Well, a sort-of-mustard tweed thing. If you could get rid of.

LADY C.: I shall make a note of it.
LADY T.: You seem to think that he will come.
LADY T.: What makes you so sure?
LADY C.: He will want to preach at me.
LADY T.: You will be careful, Millicent, won't you?
LORD C.: I don't want you carrying a candle through the City clad in a.
Charing who will do it. (There is an edge to that that has not been.

LORD C.: Oh, yes. How d'you do. Won't you—?
NEIL.: You'll have heard of me.
LORD C.: Yes, yes, of course. Poppy told me about you.
LORD C.: Yes, an old friend of the family.

NEIL.: (offended) I fail to see anything extraordinary about it.
odd, you know. So you are an admirer of Aristotle?
LORD C.: Well, I have known men who found fault with his form.
NEIL.: Then how can he bore you?

LORD C.: Yes. Yes, I'm afraid it is all I am interested in. I was.
hoping that you knew something about them.
from circles, both domestic and social, where he is the centre of.

NEIL.: I'll get used to it, I expect. I have a Scotch landlady, so.

be, but it would be interesting to know just what—.
Forgive me, won't you, for having kept you waiting. I don't need to tell.

it is that I am still in one piece.

LADY C.: Won't you stay and have some tea, Augustus?
LORD C.: Thank you, no, my dear. I should have gone some time ago.
Those evening papers that come in the afternoon are a great snare.
day we must have a talk, and you can tell me about that policy of yours.
LADY C.: Yes. Ten o'clock. We'll dine very sharp, if you don't mind,.
LORD C.: I don't know why we dine at all. They give you marvellous food.
at that place. All I have ever been able to do with it is look.
away, Lady Charing, that the only thing that brought me here was.
NEIL.: That has not been one of my activities.
LADY C.: Then I doubt if even you have known the full fury of committee.
is no limit to the variety. When one is merely making the best of this.
one, the choice is limited. But I am quite sure that ten Socialists.
with the same number of women fighting over a charity pageant.
NEIL.: Why do you have a pageant, in the first place?
And it gives all the silly women in London a focus for their silliness.
weeks, there is little energy for much else. In extreme cases a lover.
has been known to carry over till next season.
LADY C.: I mean, if one is shocked to the core by, say, the Continental.
Sunday, there can be no reaction to further shock, can there?
NEIL.: Your pageant shocks me a great deal more than your lovers.
is making you a fancy dress while some woman in the East End is.
dress would be that four people instead of one would be half-naked. If I.
NEIL.: But the State should support her invalid mother, and see to it.
that her work was productive. That she made things for the common good,.
LADY C.: Not gauds. I see. Ah, well, that will be something for you to.
LADY C.: All the people who are making money out of my pageant. The.
out the chairs. You will be kind to the little man who hires out chairs,.
LADY C.: I am sure that a well-run state will have all the chairs it.
wants, and he will be so lost. His whole life is in chairs. (Having a.
thought) Of course he may be dead by then. There is that possibility.
How long do you think it will be before the state regulates breathing?
present form is cracking under our feet. You may think you're a.
NEIL.: The people who produce the goods in this country want a share of.
the wealth that results. They aren't as ignorant as they used to be,.
they are asking questions, learning to combine, feeling their strength.
They're on the move, I tell you. Men in the factory, the pit, and the.
yards. The working people of this country. The ferment's in them.
Moving. Beginning to seethe. And what do you think the result of that is.
lead me to the guillotine, and you to the wars, and bread goes up.
NEIL.: (after a moment, leaning forward) You may not believe it, Lady.
NEIL.: I am going to lead my people out of bondage.
LADY C.: (in a tone of surprise and disappointment) Oh, you can't do.
NEIL.: (roused) I am going to lead my people out of bondage if I am.
NEIL.: (in his element) My mother was a widow, and we were so poor.
that we had meat only once a week. She brought me up on milk and.
or to be pleased at the compliment) And when I went to college—.
LADY C.: You went to University?
LADY C.: But I thought you were very poor.
LADY C.: Who paid for it? The State?
NEIL.: (resenting the catch) You could call them that, I suppose.
(Going back to the fascinating subject of his sufferings) But there.
LADY C.: I adore oatmeal, but I was never allowed to eat it, because it.
was supposed to be bad for the complexion. You don't seem to have many.
NEIL.: (definitely) I haven't any. I don't suppose you can even.
imagine what it is like to face the same food day after day.
LADY C.: No. Just a diet. It was supposed to be good for something or.
other. What did you do in the holidays?
smelling of bird-cages. There was nothing to do, and I shouldn't have.
been allowed to do it if there was. And when you left college?
NEIL.: My father was a blacksmith.
LADY C.: But you say that honours shouldn't be hereditary, don't you?
You can't take any credit for your father. You disappoint me, Mr Tummel.
Here I was, all prepared to hear a tale of a starved and thwarted life.
freedom and consideration of your childhood, mine was a penal servitude.
Are many of your party like you, by the way?
LADY C.: But you managed to fight an election.
NEIL.: (understanding the hint) Some friends put up the money.
of fact, I went to see the regular Socialist crowd this morning. There.
was some talk of my joining them. They don't like Independents. But I.
NEIL.: They talked too much. I like to do the talking myself.
LADY C.: I take it that your wife is a silent woman. Are you married,.
hadn't a wife before you asked me here?
NEIL.: Did you ask me here without my wife. I mean, without the wife I.
LADY C.: Let me tell you something even more monstrous. I would also.
have invited your wife without you, if she had been the interesting one.
LADY C.: Is this your first visit to London?
NEIL.: Uh-huh. I've never been furth of Scotland till now.
LADY C.: You must let me show you some of the lovely things.
NEIL.: (who is feeling comfortable again) On condition that you let me.
LADY C.: (without emphasis) No, I'll show you one. You won't know.
LADY C.: (matter-of-fact) Oh, yes. Before my marriage I used to work.
two days a week in the slums. I had a club for girls. And I used to help.
content with a hobby that takes less time.
now? (He tries to get a sneer into his voice but it is not very.
LADY C.: A cottage-hospital at Charing. It was my mother-in-law's.
creation, and I inherited it from her. Not so interesting as.

LADY C.: They don't like snoopers.
NEIL.: But I'm a Member of Parliament, and a Socialist!
LADY C.: Well—forgive me, but that is what the suit you are wearing.
NEIL.: You mean this suit makes me look like an artist?
LADY C.: (who likes artists) I wouldn't go as far as that. It is the.
kind of suit that an artist might wear.
LADY C.: (kindly) I'm sure it is.
contempt) But perhaps the technicality of that is too much for you.
NEIL.: It's not an impression I would like to make.
LADY C.: Then I suggest that you cast your eye over your colleagues in.
the House, and pick out something that gives the required impression.
excellent. You can't expect a body of men who habitually sleep in their.
LADY C.: On the House of Commons benches, of course.
NEIL.: (grimly) They won't sleep when I talk to them.
LADY C.: No, I think perhaps they won't.
NEIL.: (pausing to look at her a moment) Does that mean you're.
impressed with me, or just that you think I've got a loud voice? (For.
the neck. I suspect Moses had it too. He would never have been able to.
LADY C.: That's the worst of you reformers. You know so little of human.
Anything to be rid of it. (Her eye is frank and innocent; and, anyhow,.
NEIL has never thought of himself as odd) Let me give you some more.
LADY C.: I don't hate them. I merely distrust them.
NEIL.: Because they want to upset the world you know.
LADY C.: No. They love to think that they are playing God, when all.
they are doing is playing old Harry. Did you take sugar? I forget.
How can I educate you if you dislike me?
LADY C.: But I don't dislike you, Mr Tummel. On the contrary. You.
LADY C.: Very woolly, and earnest, and running round in circles, and.

get out of mine. Why don't these people go? I sometimes think that the.

LADY T.: A great many have slipped away, but no one can go officially.
in the Balkans royalty is taught when to go home.
LADY T.: The trouble is, they're enjoying themselves.
LORD C.: Then he was probably reckoning how much he would have to pay.
LADY T.: Oh, no; he was answering.
LADY T.: He appeared to be greatly interested.

LADY T.: ... But they are more respectable than the Socialists.
LADY T.: He is probably tired of his soap-box, and wants to spread.

offer a bright young man; office, honour, or employment.
without trying to make a good story out of it.
LADY C.: Gussie, you wretch, you should be ashamed of yourself. And.
you, Poppy, for aiding and abetting him.
LADY T.: We were only having a breathing-space.
LADY C.: It really is too bad of you to desert me so flagrantly.

NEIL.: You haven't had a bite to eat all night. I've been watching you.
NEIL.: Your Chief Lackey says this is what you like.
LADY C.: Yes. It was charming of you to think of it. I hope you enjoyed.
NEIL.: I found it very interesting, thank you.
LADY C.: You are looking very chic. You must admit that what you call.
NEIL.: (who is very pleased with the figure he cuts in his.
LADY C.: I hope you have had some supper.
NEIL.: I couldn't see anything I recognised.
LADY C.: Do you have to be on bowing terms with your food?
NEIL.: I have. What is so surprising about that?
LADY C.: I had somehow taken it for granted that yours was a unique.
NEIL.: She is of no interest whatever.
LADY C.: Well, I disapprove of you too, but I cannot eat supper alone.
Do you think you could pick up sufficient courage to nibble at a mystery.
LADY C.: I suggest you go back to the dining-room, ask Parker to give.
you a tray, do 'Eenie, meenie, minie, mo' among the dishes, and bring.

LADY C.: You won't be once you have tasted hock. If you don't hurry up.
I shall have finished before you come back.

LADY C.: I promised to make him pretty for your platform, not to alter.
LADY C.: What do you call them?
LADY T.: A political point of view. Where do you think he got those.
LADY T.: That is what they look like.
not occur to him to order something he could not pay for.
LADY C.: Don't be absurd, Poppy.
LADY T.: You have been taking him about quite a lot.
LADY T.: Oh, I know he is a stupid creature, that no woman in her.
senses would waste her time on. It's his profile I'm afraid of. Give a.
one morning in a plain van. Why should you imagine for a moment that I.
LADY T.: I didn't, until you mentioned his convictions. And now I keep.
LADY T.: Yes. Someone said that you had been seen riding in a bus, with.
LADY C.: Is the gravamen of the charge the bus, or the young man?
who gets a seat? Your wig is crooked.
LADY T.: You know that I am not talking about buses. It is your own.
are spoiling everything. I asked you to tone him down, not to take him.
LADY C.: Well, I am toning him down very nicely, and I think you are.
LADY T.: You are spoiling him. Running round the town with him, and.
falling in with his absurd ideas. Don't tell me that the bus-riding was.
afterthought) And if you ever tell him how you and I hopped in and out.
LADY T.: I could kill you at this very moment. That creature's head.
LADY C.: Oddly enough, I don't exist except as a brand to be plucked.
intelligent, and has hopes of making me a useful member of society.
intellectual amusement. Believe me, my dear, if he had a profile like a.
new moon, you wouldn't be in the least amused. So 'lay not that.
much better word. You can't see farther than his nose.
extravagantly, why couldn't you sit on the same platform with it, and so.
LADY T.: If a man wears a yellow suit it doesn't matter to me if he.
looked like the Archangel Gabriel.
LADY C.: But you think that I am more susceptible.
LADY T.: So there is nothing to keep you from noticing his profile.
LADY T.: You needn't be sarcastic with me. (The emphasis is on 'me').
LADY C.: Well, I got him into tails for you. He is an ornament to any.
platform. And all the thanks I get is a lecture on behaviour.
you are illogical, unreasonable, ungrateful, and tiresome.
LADY T.: And you are far too fond of being godmother to squids, and.
change of tone) We are not quarrelling, are we?
think it is very small of you, Poppy, to come and create a scene when.
you know what an exhausting evening I have had.
LADY T.: (unimpressed) You've had a lovely evening.
Balkans. A woman who wears a bath-mat is capable of anything. And I.
didn't come to make a scene. I came to tell you how lovely everything.
charming of you. I expect we are both tired.
that you were being nice to the creature, forgetting that being nice is.
a habit with you. I know that you could never waste an unnecessary.
NEIL.: Lady Tillicoultry doesn't know me, maybe, but I know her well.
NEIL.: My father used to shoe your father's horses.
LADY T.: Your father must have been a remarkable man. My father never.
NEIL.: (in righteous disgust) That's no way to speak about her father.
(Carries his tray down and places it on the opposite side of the table.
LADY C.: Don't you believe in telling the truth about one's parents?
But, of course, being a blacksmith, your father was no doubt admirable.
Now I think of it, I have never seen any account of a blacksmith.
clean work, too; you would think they would be content.
very small plates, each with a different kind of food. In an astonished.
LADY C.: (counting) ... six, seven, eight, nine. Good gracious!
NEIL.: I took a little of everything I didn't know.
NEIL.: I consider that this is part of my education.
LADY C.: Then I can only say that by tomorrow morning there will have.
been at least one part of your education that you will have paid for.
However, I am glad to see that you have brought a bottle.
NEIL.: I'm ashamed about the bottle.
LADY C.: Nobody has cause to be ashamed of that hock.
NEIL.: By the time I had made them give me all those little plates, I.
had no courage left to refuse the bottle. But of course I'm not going to.
It has nothing in common with what you call drink, (dropping her voice.
a perfect fifth) which I take to be 'something to keep the wet out'.
is the stuff that ties up a man's tongue (he thinks first of speech, of.
NEIL.: (with a swift return to the matter of fact) This will be the.
first time in my life that intoxicating liquor has ever passed my lips.
[She casts him an amused glance, but his eyes are on the glass.].
NEIL.: Is it potent? (He picks up a fork and begins on the first of his.
including clay pipes. What is this? (He refers to the dish he is.
LADY C.: You know, Neil, you are improving.
NEIL.: Because I am dressed up like a monkey?
LADY C.: (suddenly out of temper) Oh, don't be so stupid. That is the.
NEIL.: There is a difference in cut.
LADY C.: Of course. But that is a matter of individuality, not of.
The Duke of Sidborough, on the other hand, looked as if he had picked up.
a comedian's outfit at the last moment.
NEIL.: Then if it wasn't my clothes, in what way have I 'improved'?
LADY C.: You haven't told me how many working-class families could be.
or fifty families for two years.
LADY C.: When your sister got married, for instance?
LADY C.: The only difference is that you have fifty friends, and I have.
NEIL.: I don't suppose you knew half those people here tonight by sight.
LADY C.: No. But they know me. And expect to be asked to my house. And.
because they come to my house and drink my hock, someone in your beloved.
entertaining little Señor So-and-So will come out of your pocket. (As.
to come out of your pocket when I have stopped paying for them. I shall.
be surprised if you have the price of a drink left. (Noticing that.
NEIL is eating) Don't you think you had better leave that till later?
NEIL.: (who has a sweet tooth and no palate) It's fine, whatever it.
is. (He goes on eating it) So you give parties just to keep the poor.
well. That is lucky because it happens to be my duty to give them, and.
NEIL.: Work! What would you do if you had seven children and a husband.
LADY C.: Make a success of it. I should have made a very good wife for.
NEIL.: You! I don't suppose you know the price of a pound of butter.
LADY C.: (reasonably) No. But I should only have to be told once.
NEIL.: Have you a part in this pageant?
NEIL.: (after a pause, still staring, slowly) It's an odd thing, but.
until this minute I never thought of you as a real woman.
LADY C.: You must have granted me a stomach, or you wouldn't have.
NEIL.: No, I suppose not. I expect it was beginning to dawn on me.
LADY C.: Well, now that you realise that my hair lets down, am I to be.

LADY C.: If we didn't pay them, you would have to.
LADY C.: Then the State would have to pay fourteen men and a boy. It is.
for his pigs. And he is terrified, of course, of Macrae.
(Contemplatively) The Revolution is going to have a difficult time.
with Macrae. I hope you will be kind to our tenants, by the way. They.
are used to being looked after.
people who can't pay their rent?
LADY C.: It wasn't the deserving I was thinking about.
NEIL.: At least there will be no more exploiting by landlords.
LADY C.: You can go there next week-end.
NEIL.: No. I have a committee meeting on Saturday.
NEIL.: It's my own parliamentary committee.
LADY C.: All the more reason that they should wait.
NEIL.: What I have to say to them won't wait.
NEIL.: I am going to tell them that I can no longer represent them in.
Parliament. (He goes on eating matter-of-factly).
LADY C.: It can't be that. Are you serious?
LADY C.: You are going to give up your seat? But why?
NEIL.: Because I have no right to keep it. I was sent to Parliament to.
like a dummy in a suit that doesn't belong to me, having supper with a.
LADY C.: Does that prevent you from going to the House tomorrow and.
LADY C.: My dear Neil, don't be absurd.
people who could ill afford it. They have a very clear idea of the kind.
of man they want to represent them. They thought I was that man. So did.
LADY C.: But, for Heaven's sake, why—.
NEIL.: The kind of man they want wouldn't be found dead in this house.
LADY C.: Then I should have thought that the obvious course was to give.
up this house, not your constituency.
NEIL.: Giving it up wouldn't alter the fact that I liked coming to it.
look down my nose. And when I went about with you, and made you take.
buses instead of your car, I thought I was educating you; and all the.
most beautiful woman in London. Do you think a man like that is the.
LADY C.: But you also represent, I take it, the ...
lump of a fellow that got his hair cut. And on Saturday I tell my.
committee that, and they can look for a better man.
did you reach this curious decision?
NEIL.: (without thinking) Tonight. (As soon as it is said he looks as.
if he would like to take it back, but he is too late).
LADY C.: And what are you going to do if you give up your political.
NEIL.: I'll begin again, some other way. Find work in a factory,.
is absurd to the point of fantasy.
NEIL.: (dryly) I didn't suppose you would understand it.
LADY C.: You actually propose to give up your seat in Parliament.
because someone induced you to wear a white tie?
NEIL.: No. Because I'm a poor thing, but taking money under false.

you think I would stay as a hired lackey?
LADY C.: You're terribly fond of the word lackey. It's a sort of.
NEIL.: I didn't expect you to understand what conscience can do to a.
man, but I did think that you would—.
LADY C.: My dear, I am merely trying to bring a little realism into.
feathers for our nest, and all the other rewards for keeping a sensible.
your realism, and I'll keep my conscience. And now, having been educated.
NEIL.: There is nothing to discuss. I made a mistake, and I am going to.
NEIL.: Anyhow, it has nothing to do with you.
LADY C.: But I feel that it has. If I had foreseen ... If I ...

Does that mean an end of yellow suits?
LADY C.: I don't know. I haven't seen him since that reception a month.
ago. I must say, it is a great relief to me that he has found a niche.
for himself. (There is a faint shade of puzzlement, all the same, in.
LORD C.: He owes you that, my dear.
LORD C.: No. Because you got him to the reception that night.

LORD C.: Well, it's nice for the young man to come in on a flood-tide.

for his politics he might have been a Liberal from the cradle.
LADY T.: It's fantastic. A month ago he wanted the earth; now he's.
LADY T.: Don't you like him any more, Millicent? Oh, dear, I hope you.
and you prefer them straight across.
like that at all. I was hoping you would bring him to tea.
LADY T.: I don't know what you are talking about. Now that he is a.
perfectly respectable Liberal there is no reason why we should not be on.
speaking terms. It looks well on a platform. And there are one or two.
little things in the constituency that I want done. So I thought the.
nicest way would be for you to bring him to tea one day. Tea is a nice.
LADY T.: But I should have to ask him. That is quite impossible.
LADY T.: I don't know about much, darling, but you will certainly be.
There was one of those dotted lines from his nose to this door.
LADY C.: But why to this door? I have not heard from him for weeks. Why.
LADY T.: He is coming to be admired, of course. Don't you know the.

go to your club. It will not look nearly so bad after Lady Archie.

LADY T.: I was hoping that you would help me with one or two little.
Tillicoultry, I'll help you with pleasure.
LADY T.: It's mostly about my Poor Children's Holiday Home. I take it.
NEIL.: I don't know. I would have to see the books.
NEIL.: No doubt, but that's no evidence of honesty.
Oh, well, you must come and see for yourself, and make sure that I am.
not baby-farming, or whatever it is you suspect me of, and then we can.
hot-water pipes in. I won't keep you now, because I know you want to.
LADY T.: I think he is going to be a great asset to Kilcrannock.
LADY T.: Cabinet? But he isn't in the Cabinet.
ashamed to bother such a brilliant young man with my hot-water pipes.
NEIL.: (after a pause) Have you faith in me?
LADY C.: If you mean, do I believe that you can reach Cabinet rank;.
yes. If you mean, could I trust you not to give me a bad half-crown—no.
NEIL.: I seem to have become a petty crook with remarkable rapidity.
NEIL.: (thinking he sees the light) So that's what you're angry.
hand you gave me was like a haddock. (Puzzled) I thought you would be.
pleased about it. All the way down in the train I kept thinking how.
pleased you would be. (He sounds like a child deprived of a promised.
LADY C.: You must forgive me if I am slow in getting used to the idea.
When you left this room it was to become a stone-breaker or something of.
NEIL.: (indulgently) Oh, well, that was a figure of speech.
LADY C.: (with an air of innocent inquiry) A—fib, you mean?
NEIL.: Oh, no. That was logic. Pure logic.
NEIL.: It seemed to me that if I was resigning because I was too fond of.
Liberal ways, the obvious solution was to become a Liberal. Don't you.
not necessarily mean a spit in the eye.

NEIL.: (rubbing his hand over the back of his head with a rueful.
gesture) Oh, well. There's no denying my tongue runs away with me.
LADY C.: (interested) Is that what you call it—a slip of the.
up my dream of being a Moses, and maybe I dramatised myself a little.
LADY C.: And all the time you had your first Liberal pay in your.
didn't think Archie'd mention it. He had no right to tell me things like.
that, you know. He wouldn't have, if it hadn't been for the bottle.
NEIL.: (eyeing her) You're a very nasty woman when you like.
LADY C.: You sat there and ate my food and drank my wine and told a.
LADY C.: Silly lies for no other reason than to make yourself.
NEIL.: Well, that's no bad reason.
NEIL.: I'm five feet ten, I'd have you know.
LADY C.: So you are, and make yourself look big and fine and courageous.
NEIL.: Well, it serves you right for trifling with my affections.
NEIL.: Do you deny that you trifled with my affections?
way you would a new kind of dog, or a clever nigger—.
NEIL.: Oh, yes, you did. You flattered me by deferring to me, by letting.
a woman like you knows how to flatter. You didn't even have to say.
anything; you had only to look as if you were listening; or to smile.
your own special kind of smile; or to put your finger-tips on my arm to.
woman like you? It's your own fault if you get lies told you. When I am.
that one day the King will send for me?
LADY C.: No. You will send for the King.
to a full stop—testily) Now you've made me forget what I was going to.
LADY C.: (smoothly) You were going to say that by the time you reach.
that eminence you will stop telling lies because you will not have to.
cure for anything. On the contrary. I have never known a Prime Minister.
who was not an exaggerated version of what he was as a Sixth Form boy.
on) Which reminds me that I am due there now.
I am—I must confess to you—a born buyer of gold bricks. You are my.
NEIL.: You mean that you are putting me into the wastepaper basket just.
because I don't fit some sentimental picture you had of me?
interrupt) And I consider it immoral for one person to engage the.
LADY C.: Did you expect me to weep over that touching picture of a.
NEIL.: Don't you dare call me that. Just because I got a bit carried.
away one night. Do you think I'm not sincere about my mission? About the.
LADY C.: If you remember, I began this conversation by saying so.
NEIL.: You believe that I don't care a hoot what happens to the.
working-classes as long as I'm all right?
LADY C.: I wouldn't go as far as that.
NEIL.: (hastily) Well, that's something.
NEIL.: But that's an outrageous thing to say. It makes me a—a monster.
NEIL.: Why are you being so cruel this morning? (It is an expression of.
off as if I was a golochan you found in your dress.
NEIL.: You can't be as angry as that merely because I turned my coat.
LADY C.: Of course not. You could have turned your coat a dozen times.
with my blessing, provided you had been honest about it. Political.
crocodile tears on my drawing-room carpet.
NEIL.: I tell you, my tongue ran away with me. I was excited that night,.
wine for the first time, and you looking like all the pictures in the.
world—do you realise that was the first time I had seen you in.

and soul, just because on one occasion I let my imagination get the.

importance. If she takes a holiday, she is running away from you. Let me.
don't indulge in; and I am going yachting because for the last three.
months, like everyone else, I have consistently over-eaten. The Romans.
NEIL.: That is just a lot of words. You can say what you like, but you.
NEIL.: Well, call it what you like, but what I did was important to you.
If it hadn't been, you'd have been all social-insincerity this morning,.
and not cared two shakes of a lamb's tail whether I had pretended to be.
better than I was or not. You'd have been full of polite gush like that.
LADY C.: But for her, we should never have met.
LADY C.: She didn't like your ties.
NEIL.: What has that to do with it?
taking this in) You must admit that I have been very successful. Your.
NEIL.: (slowly) So that is why you invited me.
attention to change a bit of silk round my neck?
LADY C.: I found you most attractive. I thought it was your principles.
But I think Poppy was right; she said it was your profile.
NEIL.: Between the two of you, I seem to have been well chewed over.
LADY C.: Between you and Poppy I have been put to a great deal of.
inconvenience. However, since you are both the better for it, I cannot.
NEIL.: You can't make yourself the most important thing in my life and.
then walk out of it as if you were stepping into your carriage. (There.
is more threat than appeal in that) What do you think I am made of?
What do you think I am? A doll to be dressed and undressed? A dummy to.
be pushed about on a board for your pleasure?
snobbish little climber, who didn't even notice that I was a woman as.
well as a Viscountess, until it was brought to your notice that my hair.
let down. If I have been important to you, believe me I am not.
NEIL.: You know very well what I mean, and it has nothing to do with.
climbing or snobbery. It has to do with you and me.
LADY C.: The only thing that you and I have in common, Mr Tummel, is.
NEIL.: (who has come close enough to her to look into her eyes,.
speculatively) I wish I could see what you are thinking. All these.

means you're a cold woman. Then what did you want of me?
profile. But I was wrong. You are, after all, a little man. You have a.
blind eye, but no telescope to put to it.
LADY C.: That is something you are not likely to die of.
NEIL.: Not me. I'm Neil Tummel. I may be just a parlour game to you, but.
I'm going to be history to a lot of others. I'm on my way up; and you're.
going to watch me go. And if this is good-bye, let me give you something.
to remember me by. (He takes her to him with one arm, tilts her chin.
her) I've wanted to do that for a long time.
for a long time to do something for you. Something that your mother.
wrap)—the House of Commons will do that. So will your wife.
LADY C.: You will marry for prestige, of course; and to your last day.
you will never know what your wife is really thinking. As for your.
emphasis on the word 'children', since he is unconsciously admitting the.
You will be for ever explaining away your son's antics. By the time you.
are forty you will have the whole world for audience, and no one to talk.
to; and I am very sorry for you. (She does not sound particularly.
LADY C.: A man who sold his birthright for a mess of pottage.
pottage may prove worth it, let me tell you here and now that it will be.
dust and ashes in your mouth, for one reason.
live, there will be a label round your neck that you can never get rid.
be dust and ashes in your mouth.
not in triumph but in a kind of wonder—slowly) You were in love with.
don't think I shall wait for you. It is really time that I looked in at.
with you. My dear Mr Tummel, allow me to congratulate you, and to.
welcome you to the Liberal Party.
LORD C.: It's a curious world, isn't it? A month ago we Liberals had.
nothing to offer a bright young man, and now it seems the Party is a.
LORD C.: Very well, my dear. Can we drop you somewhere, Mr Tummel?

After the announcement of a further share sell-off, we examine the total spent and recovered bailing the bank out.
The Government committed to purchasing a 43.4% stake in the Lloyds Banking Group six years ago. In 2009 as part of a broader restructuring that saw the group's operations split up, the then Labour Party leadership paid around 74 pence per share to 'buy in' its shareholding. The total amount spent was just shy of £21 billion.
All shares remaining are to be sold at a minimum of the 74 pence they were purchased for in 2009. In April 2015 the market value was 79 pence, today it is 77 pence.
Today's announcement states that so far £15.5 billion has been recovered of the initial £ 21 billion spent. The Government still owns 11 percent of Lloyds worth around £6 billion at current prices. From this amount at least £2 billion will be available to the public at a discount of 5% (worth nearly 4 pence per share). In addition, those who hold on to their shares for at least one year will receive a bonus share for every ten purchased.
More information is available at gov.uk/lloydsshares as well as the opportunity to register interest as a prospective purchaser.

has been a prime factor in making.
Canada a self-reliant and independent country. It was at first a hardship, and there was every excuse.

1.1. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) are serious public health problems which, have socio economic, employment and human rights implications.
1.2. It is recognised that the HIV/AIDS epidemic will affect every workplace, with prolonged staff illness, absenteeism, and death impacting on productivity, employee benefits, occupational health and safety, production costs and workplace morale.
1.3. HIV knows no social, gender, age or racial boundaries, but it is accepted that socio-economic circumstances do influence disease patterns. HIV thrives in an environment of poverty, rapid urbanisation, violence and destabilisation. Transmission is exacerbated by disparities in resources and patterns of migration from rural to urban areas. Women, particularly are more vulnerable to infection in cultures and economic circumstances where they have little control over their lives.
1.4. Furthermore HIV/AIDS is still a disease surrounded by ignorance, prejudice, discrimination and stigma. In the workplace unfair discrimination against people living with HIV and AIDS has been perpetuated through practices such as pre-employment HIV testing, dismissals for being HIV positive and the denial of employee benefits.
1.6. Furthermore the Code seeks to assist with the attainment of the broader goals of:.
eliminating unfair discrimination in the workplace based on HIV status;.
promoting a non-discriminatory workplace in which people living with HIV or AIDS are able to be open about their HIV status without fear of stigma or rejection;.
promoting appropriate and effective ways of managing HIV in the workplace;.
creating a balance between the rights and responsibilities of all parties; and.
giving effect to the regional obligations of the Republic as a member of the Southern African Development Community.
2.1. The Code's primary objective is to set out guidelines for employers and trade unions to implement so as to ensure individuals with HIV infection are not unfairly discriminated against in the workplace. This includes provisions regarding:.
creating a non-discriminatory work environment;.
2.2. The Code's secondary objective is to provide guidelines for employers, employees and trade unions on how to manage HIV/AIDS within the workplace. Since the HIV/AIDS epidemic impacts upon the workplace and individuals at a number of different levels, it requires a holistic response which takes all of these factors into account. The Code therefore includes principles, which are dealt with in more detail under the statutes listed in item 5.1., on the following:.
creating a safe working environment for all employers and employees;.
introducing measures to prevent the spread of HIV;.
developing strategies to assess and reduce the impact of the epidemic upon the workplace; and.
supporting those individuals who are infected or affected by HIV/AIDS so that they may continue to work productively for as long as possible.
In addition, the Code promotes the establishment of mechanisms to foster co-operation at the following levels :.
between employers, employees and trade unions in the workplace;and.
between the workplace and other stakeholders at a sectoral, local, provincial and national level.
3.1. The promotion of equality and non-discrimination between individuals with HIV infection and those without, and between HIV/AIDS and other comparable health/medical conditions.
3.2. The creation of a supportive environment so that HIV infected employees are able to continue working under normal conditions in their current employment for as long as they are medically fit to do so.
3.4. HIV/AIDS impacts disproportionately on women and this should be taken into account in the development of workplace policies and programmes.
3.5 Consultation, inclusivity and encouraging full participation of all stakeholders are key principles which should underpin every HIV/AIDS policy and programme.
4.1. All employers and employees, and their respective organisations are encouraged to use this Code to develop, implement and refine their HIV/AIDS policies and programmes to suit the needs of their workplaces.
4.2. For the purposes of this code, the term "workplace" should be interpreted more broadly than the definition given in the Labour Relations Act, Act 66 of 1995, Section 213, to include the working environment of, amongst others, persons not necessarily in an employer-employee relationship, those working in the informal sector and the self-employed.
4.4. The Code should be read in conjunction with other codes of good practice that may be issued by the Minister of Labour.
5.1. The Code should be read in conjunction with the Constitution of South Africa Act, No. 108 of 1996, and all relevant Legislation which includes the following:.
Occupational Health and Safety Act, No. 85 of 1993;.
Mine Health and Safety Act, No. 29 of 1996;.
Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act, No. 130 of 1993;.
Basic Conditions of Employment Act, No. 75 of 1997; and.
5.2. The contents of this code should be taken into account when developing, implementing or reviewing any workplace policies or programmes in terms of the statutes listed above.
5.3. The following are selected, relevant sections contained in certain of the above-mentioned legislation. These should be read in conjunction with other legislative provisions.
5.3.4. In accordance with Section 187(1)(f) of the Labour Relations Act, No. 66 of 1995, an employee with HIV/AIDS may not be dismissed simply because he or she is HIV positive or has AIDS.

Race for the top slot of Chairman Senate is in full swing for which the independent candidates have assumed significance as no major party has enough numbers to do it on its own without their help.
Although, PML-N has now 34 senators, 19 short of the required number, there will be a lot of jockeying to clinch the office of the chairman.
Thus, the PML-N is short of 19 votes to hit the magic figure of 53, the simple majority, in the 104-member chamber to elect its nominee as the chairman.
In contrast, the PPP requires another 33 MPs to clinch the berth for the third consecutive three-year term. Obviously, it will be an uphill task to rally around this huge tally.

It took a little time getting here as we first had to upgrade the monitoring solution. Read all about the process here:.
Two months ago, we started having issues with Grafana, or more accurately, with the whisper backend, something we weren’t aware of back then.
It was slow and inefficient. The system experienced many crashes that caused data loss at the time, and we didn’t have any high availability or backup for the data, so it was lost.
We had to do something to resolve these issues.
carbon-cache (https://github.com/graphite-project/carbon) – Carbon is one of the components of Graphite, and is responsible for receiving metrics over the network and writing them down to disk using a storage backend.
graphite web (https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web) – A highly scalable, real-time graphing system.
First, we tried to make the best of the old system already running, something that we now understand was not possible due to the heavy traffic of metrics and concurrent users.
We wanted to be able to work on the new solution using the production metrics while not causing any disruptions on the old production system.
At this point, we already started receiving more accurate metrics with the new C compiled services. However, this didn’t solve the performance and availability issues, so we decided to create a graphite cluster. The idea was that by splitting the data between nodes, we would get better performance out of the whisper database since each query will be querying less data.
To query data out of all nodes, the graphite-web is used to collect the data from other graphite-web instances on each node.
Running with the cluster solution resulted in better performance but at a big cost. Data could be queried very fast using 4 nodes, but when we began to invite users to try the new system we suddenly encountered another big issue: the number of concurrent users.
It seems that Graphite was unable to support a large number of concurrent users. Trying to add memcached to cache the renders and the metrics, we encountered an issue with many misses while running the cluster.
By the end of the cluster project ended, we learned a few things:.
whisper as a backend is the root of our problem.
The Concurrent user issue must be addressed in the next solution (using memcached).
We need to think about the cost of the next solution as its beginning to be a big factor when scaling up.
InfluxDB (https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb), a scalable datastore for metrics, events, and real-time analytics provided the best solution to our problem.
The big problem with InfluxDB is that it required us to replace all dashboards, which can be difficult to do in some cases, and impossible in others. InfluxDB does not yet support “Join” operations between measurements and that makes some of the queries impossible.
The only thing left was to add the retention and aggregations to the data going into the InfluxDB.
Currently the new system is running for a month with only a few small issues, mostly relevant to fine-tuning the Docker daemon. In any case, data is stored on at least one of the datastores (InfluxDB or Graphite). The system can handle a greater number of concurrent users, and data is more accurate and stores metrics for 1 year.
As with all big projects, there is still work to be done, such as monitoring the system and creating better backups for the configurations.
We also noted that the way Graphite-API stores the data is by using separate measurements. This can cause a problem when using hundreds of measurements. We are still optimizing the Graphite-API in order to decrease the number of unique measurements (using Influx templates) and speed up the system.

After reading about turmoil in North Carolina's Medicare Advantage program, 85-year-old Marion Meili called with a question: Can I drop my policy and try to find a better deal on the Affordable Care Act exchange?
Short answer: No. The exchange, which offers subsidies for low- and moderate-income people, was designed to provide new options for people who don't have access to health insurance. It's not available to those who already have government coverage, including Medicare and Medicaid, or those who have qualified group plans offered by their employer.
"It's against the law for anyone who knows you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan," says HealthCare.gov, the official ACA exchange site.
Of course, there's never a simple answer for anything related to health coverage, so the site follows up with exceptions: If you're paying a premium for Medicare Part A or if you're eligible for Medicare but haven't signed up you might be able to shop on the exchange (read details here).
Medicare Advantage is an option that lets senior citizens enroll in a private insurance plan (get a primer on how the system works here). Meili's policy is with UnitedHealthcare; she tells me she got a notice of a rate hike but called the insurance company and "got it a bit cheaper." That's a good reminder that it's always smart to shop around and ask for a better deal.
It's also smart to get help. Medicare options and costs change every year. In North Carolina, call 1-855-408-1212 or visit the Seniors Health Insurance Information Program website to get advice.
A note if you live in Mecklenburg County: Shepherd's Center does face-to-face counseling on Medicare enrollment and I have it on good authority (my 80-year-old mom) that they do excellent work. Unfortunately, they're also booked for the rest of this enrollment period, which ends Dec. 7. So if you call the state SHIIP line, tell them you want your question answered on the phone or you may get referred to Shepherd's Center, which will just send you back to the phone line.
I'm hearing from people who are switching plans as they check out their new rates for health insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchange. I'm working on a story and would love to hear people's experiences, but in the meantime, the Kaiser Family Foundation offers an important tip:.
Just in case, keep proof of payment to answer any billing questions and once you’ve cancelled the old policy watch your credit card statements or, if the payment was deducted directly from a bank account, watch those charges to make sure you aren’t paying for two policies. And don’t cancel your current insurance until you have confirmation from your new carrier that you’re covered.
That's among a list of five tips for people enrolling or re-enrolling during the 2015 open enrollment period, which runs through Feb. 15. Read the other four here.
Shortly before open enrollment began Saturday, a reader who asked to be identified only as Elizabeth logged onto the Blue Cross website to try to estimate the cost of her policy in 2015. To estimate her subsidy under the Affordable Care Act, she was asked to enter her modified adjusted gross income.
I found a one-page explanation of that term created by the University of California Berkeley Labor Center. And HealthCare.gov, the official ACA website, offers a list of tips on what to include and omit in estimating the income that will be used to calculate 2015 tax credits.
Wages, salary, tips, net business income, unemployment compensation, alimony, Social Security, investment income and rental income all count toward determining how much aid you can get.
But the biggest challenge, it seems to me, is that you're not reporting what you made this year but predicting what you will make in 2015. For people with full-time salaried jobs that may be relatively easy, but for many others it's not. As John Murawski of the News & Observer reported last week, a whole lot of people are about to face up to how good their 2014 estimates were as they prepare their taxes.
At the risk of sounding like a broken record: When in doubt, get help. You can make an appointment for free personal advice from someone trained to navigate the ACA exchange by calling 1-855-733-3711 in North Carolina and 1-888-998-4646 in South Carolina (I've heard you may get a busy signal, but that should ease after the first few days.) Insurance agents and brokers can also help with the exchange.
And remember to check the source of your information. There are a lot of folks with official-looking websites and mailings trying to sell products, push agendas and maybe even rip you off. When I googled the ACA and "modified adjusted gross income," the first link that came up was a detailed explanation on ObamacareFacts.com. The page contains a note that it's "privately owned," and if you click around a bit more you'll learn that it's "run by two guys, we have no ties to any political party or organization and don’t receive funding from anyone." This unnamed duo may be as unbiased as they repeatedly profess to be and their information may be solid. But I wouldn't stake my health or money on it.
The final day was supposed to be Oct. 31, but relocation has spilled into this month. It's not that people weren't eager to help, but finding new homes for people with good minds but severely impaired bodies isn't easy.
"It’s certainly been much, much more difficult than we expected (and we knew it would be difficult)," director Jeni Kirk emailed me recently, as she worked to find a place for the last few residents to live.
The closing drew extensive coverage, and offers to help came in from nursing homes, assisted living facilities and people with "accessible" apartments to rent. But Kirk says frustrated residents and staff learned over and over that the label didn't mean a facility was ready to handle people in motorized wheelchairs who need help with bathing and other daily activities.
Likewise, assisted living and skilled nursing centers would offer to take residents, only to conclude later that they couldn't handle someone with such extensive physical needs.
"The final resident is slated to move to an apartment on Thursday of this week, but again, the bathroom is not accessible and he will likely have to get by with sponge baths until an accommodation can be made to retrofit the bathroom," Kirk concluded. "This experience has really opened my eyes to the crisis that exists for provision of accessible housing for the disabled.".
I recently made my first venture into the world of consumer cost control in health care.
As a baby boomer, I grew up trusting my doctors to tell me what was needed, with insurance picking up the tab. In recent years I've joined many of you in seeing my premiums and out-of-pocket costs rise; my family is now on a very high-deductible plan.
When my husband got a screening colonoscopy early this year, we grumbled about being stuck with a $708 bill for anesthesia and pathology ($1,370 before the insurance discount), but we weren't shocked. We were mostly grateful to get more than $2,200 covered for the rest of the procedure.
It wasn't until I did an article on hidden costs for procedures that are supposed to be fully covered that I realized we should have asked more questions. Dr. Rig Patel, president of the N.C. Society of Gastroenterologists, offered details on how and why patients can end up with big bills for a cancer screening that's supposed to be covered by all policies.
So when I got my reminder email, I was ready. First I followed Patel's suggestion to ask the questions in advance, rather than making an appointment and quizzing the doctor as the procedure is about to begin.
When I got a scheduling staffer, I asked about sedation/anesthesia. She said the gastroenterology practice had changed its approach since the last time my husband and I did this. Then patients were given Demerol/Versed, known as conscious sedation. Now they're put under with propofol, which our policy doesn't cover, unless they specifically ask for the old form of sedation.
I also asked about timing. I'd been told to expect a follow-up in five years. She said the recommendation was "four to five years," and the practice was giving me the opportunity to do it at four.
Yeah ... no thanks. When I make an appointment next year I'll ask for Demerol/Versed, which worked fine the first time. My father, a surgeon, always emphasized the slim but serious risks of anesthesia. Never be put under unless it's a medical necessity, he told me. So skipping the propofol seems like a wise medical approach, as well as a money-saver.
Some would cite this as an illustration of the value of shifting costs to patients: With more skin in the game, we stop being "passive consumers." I was pleased that the staffer got back to me quickly and had good answers. But I can't help wondering why it falls to those of us with no medical training to figure out what to ask. Wouldn't it make sense for the gastronterologist's office to lay out the medical and financial implications of a new approach and give all patients an informed choice, rather than waiting to see who speaks up?
My first try at finding a central contact for South Carolina had failed, but I told her I'd keep looking and call her back. I eventually found one (888-998-4646) by posting a query on the Facebook page of a friend who works for The Columbia State. But the challenge illustrates a key finding of a recent study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
The conclusion: North Carolina tapped longstanding partnerships between health care and consumer groups, worked together to create a strong message promoting enrollment and created a central scheduling system that made it easy for people to get help signing up.
"The scheduling system tracked data on appointments, sometimes enabling organizations to deploy additional Navigator support in areas with high demand," the report says. "...The establishment of a central toll-free number helped brand the Marketplace and create a unified message about where to go to obtain enrollment information.".
The system wasn't perfect, it continues, but is serving as a national model for Enroll America, a nonprofit group described as playing a central role in North Carolina's success.
"In contrast to the collaborative atmosphere in North Carolina, there were notable conflicts in South Carolina," the report says. "To the shock of many community-based organization, the largest Navigator grant went to an out-of-state, for-profit agency" (DECO Recovery Management of Maryland). As reports at the time indicated, the results were fragmented and confusing.
Smith says he never got any kind of confirmation, bill or policy and remained uninsured. Now the Charlotte woman is wondering: How can he do it this year and make sure it’s right?
If you decide to go it alone, look for a bill from the insurance company you chose. Enrollment isn’t complete until the buyer has made the first payment, says Madison Hardee, a Legal Services of Southern Piedmont lawyer who is a health care navigator.
"However, we encourage consumers to be proactive and contact their insurance company a day or two after selecting a plan," Hardee added. "That way, they can confirm coverage and go ahead and pay the first month’s payment over the phone.".
My wife and I got on the affordable care plan last year. Do we have to do anything to renew it?
No. If you do nothing by Dec. 15, the plan will automatically renew. But look at the statement from your insurance company detailing any changes in the plan or premium. Experts say it’s smart to go online, update your information and see if there are better deals this year.
In fact, the reader who sent this question followed up later that day saying he had just gotten a letter from Coventry saying his old policy was cancelled and offering a new one at three times his current premium, with a higher deductible.
How long do immigrants have to be in the country to qualify for insurance on the exchange?
Eligibility is based on legal status, not length of residence. Those who have become citizens, hold a green card or have been granted asylum or refugee status are eligible. People who are not in the United States legally can’t participate, regardless of how long they’ve been here. See www.healthcare.gov/immigrants/ for details.
Most rulings from lower courts have sided with those who say the federal exchange those states use is valid, but the review raises the prospect that it could be deemed illegal. There's a lot at stake: The first time around, more than 325,000 North Carolinians got tax credits to reduce the cost of health insurance.
“People should go ahead and sign up, and the Supreme Court will hopefully go the right way,” said Jost, a law professor who's the author of a health law casebook. “Why would (Congress) have created the federal exchange if it can’t do anything?”.
Brandon, a professor of political science and health policy, agrees: “People would be making a big mistake if they hold off on enrollment thinking it may not be there next year.”.
An enrollment Q&A by Margot Sanger-Katz of The New York Times reached the same conclusion: "Ultimately, the case could mean that people in those states (using the federal exchange) who are getting subsidies to help pay for health insurance will no longer be able to receive them. But the case is a long way from being decided and won’t take money away from people who sign up for insurance now.".
At an enrollment kickoff Wednesday, Charlotte City Council member LaWana Mayfield talked about "fear tactics" being used to deter the people who are most likely to lack health insurance -- young people, African Americans and Latinos -- from signing up. She said people are "being told it will be taken away.".
"We cannot let fear stop us from gaining access to health care," Mayfield said.
One thing seems certain: The political strife over "Obamacare," approved in 2010 with no Republican votes, will rage on in 2015, as the GOP gains a majority in the Senate as well as the House.
ACA window-shopping: What are you seeing?
The 2015 rates were posted on HealthCare.gov today, allowing people to start preparing for Saturday's start of the open enrollment season. I plugged my info in and quickly got a menu of plans. But because I have workplace insurance and didn't do this last year, I don't have much sense of how rates and plans are changing.
So if you already have insurance through the exchange, please take a peek and let me know what you see. You can let your current plan renew automatically, but experts say it's smart to check the 2015 options to see if you can get a better deal.
Update: I'm hearing from people who went to their personal account and couldn't get anything new. What you have to do is go to the general HealthCare.gov page and enter general info (zip code, income and age/smoking status of those who will be insured) to get rates for 2015. I don't think you'll be able to get an official individual quote until Saturday.
A few reminders: The Mecklenburg branch of Get Covered America will hold an opening day enrollment and information event at the Children and Family Services Center, 601 E. Fifth St., from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 15. If you plan to apply, bring your Social Security number, date of birth, employer information, proof of household income and policy numbers for any existing coverage.
While you can't sign up for subsidized insurance until Saturday, you can schedule an appointment for in-person assistance in North Carolina now by calling 1-855-733-3711.
And you can get a lot of helpful tips by downloading HealthInsurance.org's "Insider's Guide to Obamacare's Open Enrollment.".
How much will you pay at tax time if you still don't have health insurance? How can you minimize hassles when the Affordable Care Act exchange opens for 2015 enrollment on Nov. 15? Is there anything you need to do if you got insurance on the exchange this year?
"The Insider's Guide to Obamacare's Open Enrollment," a 38-page free e-book produced by healthinsurance.org, provides some of the clearest answers I've seen to these and other questions. To get a copy, go to this link and provide your email address (you're signing up for a newsletter, but you can unsubscribe if you're not interested).
A couple of crucial points: If you want your 2015 insurance to be in effect on Jan. 1, you have a short window -- Nov. 15 to Dec. 15 -- to shop on HealthCare.gov. And if you're among more than 357,000 North Carolinians who bought 2014 plans on the exchange, there are good reasons to check whether your plan is still the best deal, rather than letting this year's plan automatically renew.
The guide predicts the website will work better than it did last year -- and even explained why I've had so little luck getting any insurance folks to talk to me about the testing: "Insurers (who have tested the 2015 site) are bound by a confidentiality clause that prohibits them from discussing the results of their testing with the media.".
But with a three-month window this year, compared with six last year, the authors still suggest starting early and doing groundwork in advance. For those who are so inclined, you can call 1-855-733-3711 now to make a post-Nov. 15 appointment for in-person assistance in North Carolina.
Get Covered Mecklenburg plans a big opening day enrollment and information event at the Children and Family Services Center, 601 E. Fifth St. It will be from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Nov. 15. If you plan to apply, bring your Social Security number, date of birth, employer information, proof of household income and policy numbers for any existing coverage.
Premiums for individually-purchased health insurance rose an average of 49 percent during the first year of the Affordable Care Act, with young men seeing rates go up 78 percent, according to a new nonpartisan review of 2013 and 2014 rates.
An increase is no surprise. The ACA mandated a higher level of benefits for all policies and eliminated the practice of denying coverage or boosting rates based on medical conditions.
But Kev Coleman, head of research and data for HealthPocket, says he was caught off guard by the size of the hikes. "I thought it was going to be a lower amount," he said Tuesday.
HealthPocket, a health insurance comparison website owned by Health Insurance Innovations, compared premiums for nonsmoking 23-, 30- and 63-year-old men and women in the two largest metropolitan areas of each state. The study includes 2014 policies sold on ACA exchanges and independently. It does not include group rates for employer-provided insurance. And the 2014 rates don't factor in the government subsidies that reduced payments for most people who bought on the exchanges.
The youngest men saw the biggest hike, from an average of $145 a month in 2013 to $258 this year, a 78 percent increase. Again, it's no surprise that men took a hit. The ACA eliminated the practice of charging women more because of the possibility of pregnancy and other gender-specific expenses.
The oldest men saw the smallest percentage increase (23 percent), but that's partly because they had the highest 2013 rates ($603 a month, going up to $741).
The report notes that the comparison is "multifaceted and prone to political misuse." You can find a discussion of the issues in the report's conclusion -- and with midterm elections less than a week away, you can also bet on seeing some simplified versions circulating soon.
Actually, it's a viral email that FactCheck.org labeled "nonsense" when it started circulating at income tax time, now updated for election season. Here's the version Gubbins got, forwarded by a cousin in Tennessee.
(Celebrating 42 years of Professional Service).
If you think that it is important enough that everyone in the U.S. should know this, pass it on. If not, then delete it.
Here's what FactCheck had to say: "Some of these figures aren’t accurate, and none of these increases took effect on Jan. 1, 2014, or had anything to do with the Affordable Care Act. And the claim that 'not one Republican voted to do these' is false.".
It's not that the ACA doesn't include tax hikes. It does, including increased Medicare taxes on high earners, a new tax on high-cost employer-sponsored insurance plans and penalties for people who don't get coverage. But this list seems aimed at creating outrage and anger before people go to the polls next week, not analyzing the health care program.
William Heath is indeed the chairman and CEO of Barrington, a Houston-based financial firm with offices in Texas and California. When I inquired, he noted that he didn't write the email, but he didn't deny forwarding a message filled with inaccuracies.
"No matter when or who caused the increases, we, the taxpayer, will be paying them," Heath said in an email. He cited the final paragraph from the FactCheck report: "Having said all that, we’ll note that taxes have gone up for some as a result of Obamacare. The law imposes a 3.8 percent tax on net investment income that applies to people who earn more than $200,000 a year for singles, or $250,000 for joint filers. It also levies an additional Medicare tax of 0.9 percent on wages, salaries and self-employment income for people in those income groups. However, these changes also took effect in 2013, not 2014.".
It's timely because many of us are getting 2015 health insurance packets from our employers and learning that premiums will rise. But while it can't hurt to check out HealthCare.gov (the site says "window shopping" info on 2015 rates is coming in early November), it's unlikely you'll find a better deal.
As the only full-time employee, I've got my husband and 25-year-old son on my Observer policy (the ACA requires employers to offer coverage until children turn 26).
Our son works two part-time jobs, neither of which offers health insurance. His income would likely qualify him for a hefty tax credit. But I was initially told that because the ACA makes him eligible for my plan he can't claim that aid.
I'm glad we have options, but it does make for complex choices. And in North Carolina, the calculation has to include whether his 2015 income might dip below $11,670, plunging him into the coverage gap in which he would no longer be eligible for aid. That's an issue in states that have declined to expand Medicaid, which was supposed to fill that gap for low-income adults.
Grissom, who has young adult children of her own, says she was also unclear on how this works until she started digging. "We both learned something new today," she said. "And like everything else ACA-related – it’s complicated!".
When I called him recently to ask about hidden costs, he was eager to talk. The situation is changing rapidly for the better, he said, but the situation is still "very frustrating and very difficult" for doctors and patients.
A screening colonoscopy for people 50 and older is supposed to be fully covered under the Affordable Care Act. But depending on your policy, you could get a bill for sedation, for a pathologist's service or even for the whole procedure if precancerous polyps are found. Patel says private insurance companies are coming around to full coverage, but there are still exceptions -- and patients who get bills based on outdated information. His advice: Work this out with the insurance company and the billing office before you show up, rather than trying to wrangle with your doctors and nurses when the time comes.
Don't go to a hospital for the procedure unless there's a medical reason; it can double or triple your bill, Patel says. And ask how you'll be sedated. Some doctors administer Demerol and/or Versed to induce drowsiness and reduce pain. That's not likely to generate a separate bill. However, Patel says the trend is toward using propofol, which puts patients into a deeper sleep and must be done under supervision. He said his practice in Raleigh has shifted from an anesthesiologist to a certified nurse anesthetist to cut costs. Ask your doctor about the medical and financial issues beforehand.
Can a patient skip the sedation altogether? "If they're motivated we will do that," Patel said, but it's far from ideal. "You need a very quiet, peaceful patient who's not moving around. We want to be able to focus on the procedure and not on that uncomfortable patient.".
A recent conservative poll found that 60 percent of voters want Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Anderson is executive director of The 2017 Project, which promotes a conservative agenda. He argues that Kaiser isn't the "gold standard" on health care polling that many in both parties believe it to be, but "a pro-Obamacare outfit.".
But there's an important kernel of truth in Anderson's piece when he notes that "improve the law" and "replace it with something else" are vague options. That's the nature of public polling; we get people's gut reaction to broad terms, not an in-depth analysis. From what I can tell, most Americans agree that our health care system needs a lot more work and few of us know how to make that happen.
So here's my suggestion: If you're trying to think through what needs to happen next year, check out Politico's recent piece on Obamacare 2.0. The online magazine asked 15 leaders in the health care scene to describe the next steps. The authors span the political spectrum. Some tout the act's successes while others proclaim it a disaster. But they all talk about follow-up actions, whether that's creating a single-payer system (independent Sen. Bernie Sanders), rolling out a new system that emphasizes choice and cost control (GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander) or making adjustments to what's in place. Reading this piece takes time, but it's the kind of discussion regular people need to tap into if we want to get beyond sound bites.

A major police investigation is under way after a woman was raped at knifepoint by a masked man at a house in Rotherham.
The 25-year-old was at a property in Grange Lane, Maltby, when two men wearing masks entered and threatened her with a knife before one carried out the attack.
Detective Inspector Simon Palmer, who is leading the investigation, said: “We understand that this in an incredibly distressing incident and specialist officers are supporting the victim and her family.
“I can reassure members of the public that a thorough investigation is underway including detailed forensic work, house to house enquiries and we are reviewing CCTV footage of the area.".
The attacker was around 5ft 10ins tall and wearing a light coloured jumper, blue jeans, a black belt and white trainers.
The second man was wearing a black hooded top and blue jeans.

Bravo here with a jam-packed post-E3 Halo Bulletin! The team endured an exciting, chaotic week at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, and we’ve survived to tell the tale. However, before we do so, I’ve got something that I am particularly excited to tell you about.

Living in Arizona drastically shortens the off-season for me, especially since I work for the Arizona Fall League and my “season” doesn’t end until the week before Thanksgiving, and despite all the distractions this year was no exception.
It seems just like yesterday I was sitting in the press box at the Peoria Sports Complex with MLB.com writer Bernie Pleskoff (Twitter: @BerniePleskoff, give him a follow, he will respond to questions) wondering if Billy Hamilton will hit enough to play regularly (he won’t).
I went to breakfast with a buddy on Tuesday morning and drove past the Rangers and Royals complex near my house, and there were players on both sides running, hitting and throwing, so I can confirm at least two teams have started.
I know some people here won’t believe what someone else says and unless they see players on the field themselves Spring Training is just a rumor, but it is true.
Well said, Chuck — even if you had to take a jab at WAR at the end. LOL.
Bauer’s a talented kid but his head gets in his way, maybe a change of scenery would do him good.
He’ll be 27 in March and just came off the best season of his career, hitting .300/.389/.474 with 13 HR, and 11 triples.
It’s funny. Baseball-Reference’s WAR has Fowler as a below-average CFer. I didn’t think so, but I guess everyone in the same league as Andrew McCutchen is going to be below-average.

Surprise and Peoria are on the same road about ten miles apart. The furthest drive would be Surprise to Mesa, which is about 50 miles.
Pujols didn’t play last year when the Angels went, Angels play twice this year hopefully I’ll see him.
Well I have to assume that you’ll be working. I don’t think you just watch games all day, so there’s a chance you could miss some players here and there.
I don’t care if all he does is throw a bullpen..I’ll be happy.
“Well I have to assume that you’ll be working. I don’t think you just watch games all day, so there’s a chance you could miss some players here and there.”.
Oh, God, it’s a nightmare, especially early on with all the substitutions.
I do the scoreboard so I know how many runs are scored and how many hits there are, but what individual guys do I have no idea most of the time.
Where the park is isn’t so bad because there’s an elementary school next door and a hospital across the street, but the further away you get the worse it is.
Probably why the city doesn’t allow the Brewers to play night games.
Wonder if he hires his brother.
This guy is a relief pitcher. How does a relief pitcher get arthroscopic knee surgery? What could he have possibly done that would have hurt his knee?
And then his mom put her tit in your hand.
@23 I used to live in the same town as Rick Sutcliffe. Never could figure out where in Lee’s Summit specifically, but I could guess. Somewhere up in Blackwell probably.
I did. Then I went after Maurice Ashley. He is from Jamacia, so I thought we would play for some good stuff.
I went to Spring Training in 2008 and 2009 in Arizona and it was a lot of fun. Perfect weather. Meanwhile, the teams in the grapefruit league are being rained out.
This year I’m hoping to pop down to Florida for some games on a weekend, but I’m kinda being jerked around by the Navy and will actually be moving again in a few weeks.
I’m all the way up in Saratoga Springs, but I think I’ll make my way to the city one weekend.
Dear lord. Saratoga. You might as well get your seersucker suit out right now.
Drinks are on you if you hit that trifecta.
You know a way to get Raul’s blood pressure up?
Idiot. He deserves it. It’s friggin February 15th and he tore a muscle. How? Everyone throwing a baseball at this point in the year is throwing at like fucking 40% from maybe half their normal distances.
I saw Liriano in the AFL and he was always showing off his arm, making hero throws when it wasn’t necessary.
“Playing catch” could be long-tossing or some other drill, doesn’t necessarily mean two guys standing ten feet apart throwing marshmallows.
After killing ourselves with fat and cholesterol, we walk across the complex to watch afternoon practice.
First time in the cage is bunting.
Lucky for me tonight is my wife’s night out..don’t have to worry about formulating a lie in explaining why my pants are wet.
“The dog puked and I had to wash him”.
There may not be an arbitration hearing ths year. Will be a first if that happens.
Point. Knowing his stuff throughout the years, I can see last year being an abnormality with a massive ERA drop, but he still knows how to K a guy with his stuff.
It’s a bit of a gamble, I’m just assuming numbers stay roughly the same. For all we know, both of these guys could get mauled by the ALE. And Verlander is the best pitcher in baseball for my money. Scherzer has damn near the best stuff too. They’re a strong contender as well… But you did point out most of their games are against an incredibly weak AL Central. If ever you wanted a division to pad your numbers in, it’s us.
He’s a good #3. He’s an excellent #4.
@71 When you throw three digits down broadway, not really. A fastball shouldn’t be your out pitch, but it is with him.
It doesn’t always need to be 96 mph.
As you can tell, another big part of my philosophy is owning the inside of the plate and don’t be afraid to drill a guy straight in the knee if you have to. The head’s protected, their knee sure as shit ain’t.
Only if you have to. Brushing back ain’t anything new to pitching. I’m just a little dirty about it. Backs guys right the fuck off the plate and it makes owning the inside that much easier.
There’s a reason why 70% of all pitches thrown in baseball year in and year out are fastballs.
Cameron, there is no HAVE TO try to hurt someone And backing someone off the plate is completely different than trying to hurt them or damage their knee. You do that, & if someone MUST get hurt, I hope it is you by the batter & not him. Same goes for, say, Clemens & Piazza. Though either of them are exponentially more able to defend themselves from an aasault.
135 comments & counting, almost all strongly against him. I did not know about the affair w/the 15 year old who committed suicide. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/18/roger-clemens-hall-of-fame-vote-not-.losing-sleep_n_2713015.html.
Yeah that sucks for Gamel. Another lost year. This guy is gonna be a DH in a few years anyway so hopefully his career won’t be shut down because of it.
You don’t teach Little Leaguers to throw at batters because they don’t have the control, and because they are just kids.
They’d be even more potent if they kept the Minor League Player of the Year.
@90 No. Throw inside, yes, but not knock hitters down. It’s little league, they’ll drill asses on their own. =P.
It doesn’t, and not only that, on a bet you couldn’t find me a 12 year old that could throw a cutter.
Didn’t take long to get California out of your system, huh? LOL.
4/70 is best offer I’d give him.
Trade him to Texas for Andrus and a couple of prospects and I’d drive him to the airport myself.
I think the Steinbrenner kids are smart enough to realize by now that having a $20 million player at every position doesn’t guarantee a ring.
I know they can afford the luxury tax, but why pay it if you don’t have to?
For 8 months, 30 hours a week Raul. But likely you will have me a ballet ticket seller-or in a Tutu-as a rhetorical device. Knock yourself out.
I know some try to back folks off the plate. But there is no question that some do it maliciously. And just the intent to actually hit, or not caring about the effect, is malicious, whether successful or not. Though intentions are often ambiguous.
He was intending to come inside and maybe even hit Bonds, but there was clearly no intent to injure.
Not sure how much I buy this, or if it’s even possible, but I heard this in passing on Monday.
Apparently, the San Francisco Giants are so pissed at Melky Cabrera that he will not be given a World Series ring.
Yeah, he juiced. But if you don’t give him the ring, technically you could go after all the World Series rings won by PED users over the years.
I think they should give him the ring. Just cut off all ties with him if you want to be a jerk about it. Don’t invite him back to the stadium when they have those nights honoring the title. Don’t invite him to events…that sort of thing.
His suspension wasn’t a detriment, it was a favor.
But you could also say the Giants wouldn’t have been in 1st place without him in the 1st half of the season.
Melky Cabrera sucks ass..he’s a fourth OF who got cut by two teams, then juiced his way to a 200 hit season and a ring and is now cashing checks he otherwise would’ve only seen in a wet dream.
The Giants doing so well in the 2nd half is largely credited to Buster Posey. I understand that.
But steroids or not, Melky was a big part of the team’s offense until he was suspended. If the Giants had Pence instead of Cabrera for the entire year, the Giants might have wound up missing the playoffs entirely.
I’m not saying we have to like Melky. Just give him his ring and let him play out his days in obscurity in Canada.
David Price says he probably won’t ever play for the Yankees because of their no facial hair policy. He thinks it’s stupid. Frankly, so do I.
Hart built some of the best offenses ever seen in the game.
Price could win this year in Tampa. No doubt.
Maybe I’m wrong, but I really don’t think a few moustaches and beards are going to destroy the Yankees empire and brand.
I will be at the ballpark on Saturday at 10:30 for a 1PM game.
Would Tony Conigliaro have been a HOFer if he didn’t get hurt? Impossible to say, but his numbers were on the right track.
“We’re supposed to get snow on Saturday, Chuck.’.
People make too big a connection between strikeouts and getting on base, slugging. Intuitively I can understand why. However we have loads of historical data that shows that strikeouts have very little connection to how often a team gets on base, how well it slugs and, in turn, how good a team is at scoring runs.
We should be much more concerned with how often or how many times a team grounds out. That’s an indication of weak contact and when a team that grounds out a lot gets a runner on base, there is a much better chance for double plays.
It’s not wise to build a team at the major league level being obsessed with how often major league hitters strikeout. That should be way down on the list and way behind things like how well a hitter gets on base and slugs and runs the bases.
“Top 10 scoring teams over the last 25 years and where they ranked in their leagues in strikeouts”.
True, but they are a detriment to winning a WS so with that in mind see the problem?
“But we are discussing whether strikeouts or strikeout rate matter to scoring runs at the major league level, not anything about strikeout-to-walk ratio.”.
Actually that’s what YOU are talking about because you can’t win the actual argument that was brought up by me here and continued at your site.
Before I get to reading the most recent posts….
And for the record…I called it.
The Giants struck out 41 times and the Tigers struck out 36 times in last year’s World Series.
The Giants struck out 51 times and the Cardinals struck out 49 times in last year’s NLCS.
So the Giants struck out 131 time to their opponents’ 128 in last year’s postseason.
“Oh, I’m pointing that out because I’m a Giants homer, right?”.
I’m biting my tongue so hard it’s bleeding.
Also, how do you explain other teams that have won the World Series and struck out more often and at a higher rate than every other team in their leagues? The ‘27 Yankees and ‘04 Red Sox come to mind. To claim that high-strikeout teams don’t reach or win the World Series is disingenuous.
The post-season is a small sample size. And you are going to read into a 3-k difference? 131-128? Well, you did.
Not a big difference, right? The ‘27 Yankees had 1644 hits, the ‘12 Giants 1495, a difference of 149, or almost one per game.
The ‘27 Yankees walked 642 times, the ‘12 Giants 483 times, a difference of 159, or one per game.
The Yankees scored 976 runs, the Giants 718, a difference of 258.
A fact we established here four years ago.
Babe Ruth led the league with 89.
In 2013, he would have been 71st.
The Red Sox did the same in in 2004.
This discussion seems like a big ol’ cherry picking festival.
For the record, Atlanta was 7th in the NL in scoring last year, and 17th overall.
Strikeouts don’t matter…as long as you hit for power when you make contact.
“Strikeouts don’t matter…as long as you hit for power when you make contact.”.
My point is that it’s a mistake to conclude they will be a bad or mediocre offense because they have a lot of high strikeout hitters. The only things that matter to offense are on-base, slugging and, to a lesser degree, baserunning. How often a team makes a particular type of out just doesn’t tell us much of anything about how goo they are offensively.
“My point is simple: Some fans and some in the media are making too much of the Braves likely propensity to strikeout a lot in 2013.”.
It’s still a bit on the chilly side, so the veteran guys will be going through the motions for the first few games, especially those playing next weekend in the WBC. I don’t expect to see Ryan Braun get more than an AB per game, nor do I expect to see Yovanni Gallardo do anything more strenous than signing autographs.
There are still things to watch though..teams have jobs up for grabs (Brewers=first base) and everyone needs bullpen arms, so while most guys will jake it for the first week, some others will be busting their nuts from the first pitch. And with the WBC guys gone, someone has to play, so they’ll be looking to impress the manager and GM against ML competition, even if they have little chance of breaking camp.
If Green ends up playing a lot at first they’ll need a backup for Ramirez, but, again, they have enough depth.
Ten bucks says the Braves don’t win 85 and are eliminated before Labor Day.
“The only things that matter to offense are on-base,”.
Lowrie’s the backup everywhere and that’s a good call, he’s like Craig Counsell..not good enough to play everyday but a very dependable guy when you need him.
I don’t like Oakland’s pitching staff, too many marshmallow throwers, they don’t miss enough bats. Not sure if there’s a rotation spot open at this point, but if I’m Beane I’ve got one eye on the field and one on the trade/waiver market.
Thanks Raul..should have made this an article, but too late now.
This is not necessarily true at the major league level. Again, see a team like 2004 Red Sox, who led the league in strikeouts, scoring, OBP, SLG.
Put your $29.99 for your Baseball Reference Play Index subscription to good use and go check and see just how few times that’s happened.
“Find a way to factor in injuries and I’ll take that bet.”.
Translation: You’re not confident at all.
You can’t just point to the 2004 Red Sox as the justification for your arguments. You need a little more than 1 team. I know what you’re saying, but as a Yankees fan, I have a bunch of qualms with that Sox team to begin with. Chuck may disagree, but Joe Torre blew that damn ALCS. Boston shouldn’t have even been in the World Series, much less won it.
Chuck, any time a team has a good OBP and SLG, they are going to score runs, regardless of how many time they strike out. That’s my point. Offense is about getting on base and slugging and baserunning. If you do all those things well, it doesn’t matter if you strike out a ton.
Raul, a lot of the highest-scoring teams in the history of baseball finished near the top of their league in strikeouts. It’s not just one team.
400 years ago, that same guy said the world was flat.
Not made up per se, but gathered by people who have no idea what the they’re doing.
Baseball’s been played for well over 100 years, something happening once in awhile in a ten year span is coincidence, it’s not something you mortgage your house on. At least not if you have any common sense.
What is it about Lars Anderson that people don’t like?
Raul, I think the author glossed over it because that wasn’t what the article was about. It was about people freaking out because the Braves’ hitters are probably going to strikeout a lot.
Lefty33, I’ve shown that the data shows no relationship between team strikeout rate and team run scoring. Where’s your data that shows that there is? I’m waiting on it. I’ll be happy to change my views if you can bring that data.
No, Chuck. I’m more comfortable with my own biases, own preferences, own assumptions, even if they are contrary to what data overwhelmingly suggests. Clearly that’s the way to live.
“Where’s your data that shows that there is? I’m waiting on it. I’ll be happy to change my views if you can bring that data.”.
I’ll be happy to change my views if you can bring that hard data/argument except that I already know you can’t because you’re an intellectual wuss that likes to make big statements but when proven wrong never has the balls to either fight back or admit to being wrong in the first place.
So we’ve got an almost unbroken run of a quarter century of teams playing in the WS with below and way below league average strikeout numbers, yet you continue to say that’s irrelevant.
How is that based on what has happened?
How is that not based on you following your own flawed ideology while you check logic and what actually happened at the door?
“You’re probably better off doing the same or else you are going to be in a bunker somewhere with a tinfoil hat, surrounded by canned goods.”.
But hey I guess we all have our limitations.
High strikeout teams do sometimes appear in and win the World Series. If strikeouts were as big a deal as you seem to think, no team that strikes out a lot would ever win the World Series. But they have.
I’m simply relying on the data and the accounting of events that shows that there is not correlation between strikeout rate and run scoring.
My only ideology is getting as close to the truth as possible. I don’t think you get there by being arrogant enough to think you’re own views and biases and preferences are better than what the data reveals.
“Strikeout rate has no relationship to scoring runs. That’s a fact.”.
It happens once in awhile, so by that standard, you’re right.
The odds of success with that type of approach are so, so high.
Some would see a trend, theme or maybe even a blueprint for success but I already know that you see it as an “anomaly” or some sort of babipian “luck”.
Keep on digging and throwing up smokescreens to try and deflect your lack of an argument but strikeouts are the most useless out that can be made and the team the avoids them puts themselves in a better place to win versus teams that swing from the heels like a bunch of hillbilly cavemen.
Look at the graph in the Capitol Avenue Club piece. The dots are all over the place. That means there is no relationship to speak of between strikeout rates and runs scored. Sometimes high-scoring teams strikeout a lot, sometimes they don’t. There is just no relationship there.
He should be a league average player if he went on the field and just stood there.
Either way, enjoy working at Home Depot, Lars.
But there weren’t 30 teams until 1998.
You want to try another way to refute the data that doesn’t jive with your biases?
“There is no pattern as to what type of teams appear in the WS, certainly not offensively.”.
If the data strongly suggests something that doesn’t jive with your views, perhaps you consider at least be open to your views being wrong. Trying your best to lie about whether the data is actually an honest and correct account of what happened when there is no reason to makes you look desperate and arrogant and wanting to cling to wrongly-held views on a subject.
You don’t freak out when 25 year old Alex Rodriguez strikes out 135 times because he’s hitting .318/.399/.622 with 52 bombs and 18 steals and he’s playing GG quality defense.
Nevermind. I can’t even talk about it. I’m getting too angry.
“on the graph..each dot represents one team, right?”.
What does this have to do with the graph in the Capitol Avenue Club piece?
Of course no hitter should go to the plate thinking, “I’m just going to swing, strikeouts be damned.” But he should think, “I’m going to wait on a pitch that I can really barrel up and lay off pitches that will just lead me to ground out or pop out weakly.”.
“What really annoys me is when people who don’t know a goddamn thing about hitting try to tell me that a player would be WORSE by striking out LESS.”.
However, Lefty has pointed out that teams that strike out less have won most of the World Series in the past 20 years or so.
Or maybe it’s a sample size of 20, which is quite a bit less than 711.
“Of course no hitter should go to the plate thinking, “I’m just going to swing, strikeouts be damned.”.
Yet that’s exactly what more and more of the league does every year.
“Yet that’s exactly what more and more of the league does every year.”.
Fuck you too, John, stay out of it.
I’m not betting on anything, except for the Pirates owner (is it Coonelly?) saying that Pittsburgh should compete for a title this year.
Lefty33, Yes, I’m sure guys who work all their lives to reach the majors go to the plate completely careless as to whether they make an out of any kind.
In your case, the really bad trade of a starting pitcher for a 7th inning reliever.
For you to use facts? And not just made-up bullshit.
Frankly, I don’t see your correlation. But that is just me.
More and more guys are following into the wanna-be Sports Center highlight reel approach to hitting as opposed to doing what is best for their team. No need to learn to properly bunt or hit the ball to the right side to move runners along when you can swing from your heels to be Superman and attempt to pad your stats for your next contract.
“Strikeouts have gone up pretty much every year historically for a variety of reasons that I spelled out in my piece. It has nothing to do with carelessness of hitters.”.
Hmmm, ever strike you that maybe you’re the one who’s full of shit?
No one had mentioned the word scouting until now.
Braut, outstanding research, to say the least. Which I will, since it’s Friday!!! See you guys tomorrow. Unless I start my article/research in earnest.
If you are just going through specific examples, those are anecdotes, not something that can show you whether there is or isn’t correlation.
I’m so sick of this particular argument. It’s just picking two players to suit an argument. Watch this:.
It’s using ALL OF THE DATA AVAILABLE to determine a conclusion.
That’s what should happen John, but you and I both know that’s not how it’s done.
I stopped counting at 70 those teams who struck out less than 15% and averaged more than five runs.
Conversely, have you watched Mark Reynolds hit in batting practice? He literally hits the ball farther than any player I have watched with the possible exceptions of Kevin Mitchell and Bo Jackson. What do you think Reynold’s career would look like if he struck out half of what he currently does? It is scary to think of THAT GUY, not so much the one we are stuck with.
I have a hard time believing a player could ever become worse at hitting by cutting down his strikeouts.
Building your team around not-striking-out is a great way to lose 95 games every year.
So, post #251 is gonna get ignored?
I’m just curious what the rebuttal to that is.
Shaun, I have defended you in your absence re: folks having been mean to you. And all here should be free to join the debate. But here-as you did at the end of your last sojourn here-you have become provocative when others had started out being restrained & welcoming. It is true that there was no SM vs. traditionalists argument, & that some take a side in one matter does not prove that they are only ever in one tribe.
“If strikeouts were as big a deal as you seem to think, no team that strikes out a lot would ever win the World Series. But they have”.
That statement is clearly wrong. Ks could be a big deal or not, but what happens occasionally proves nothing. Especially with many variables.
He stops by two or three times a year blowing his sabermetric horn then runs back to his mommy.
Shaun will never go on a cruise around the world because he’s afraid of falling off.
Chuck, do you know how to read graphs? It clearly shows that there’s zero correlation.
I don’t know what’s happened to you lately, maybe it’s the fear of being locked underwater for six months, but you’ve really turned into a real fucktard.
Roughly 15% of those teams who averaged more than 4.5 runs a game struck out less than 15% of the time.
@262, there are what – 15 points above 20%? Maybe 20? That’s a ridiculously small sample size to draw a conclusion from.
Lol @262 – well played. I don’t even want to know where that nickname came from.
If you’re numbers are telling you strikeouts don’t hurt offensive outcomes, then you are asking the wrong question.
So we’re sitting in the press box today freezing our fucking nuts off watching BP. We saw 90 minutes of Brewers BP and only saw two balls go out, and we’re figuring between the small breeze and 60 degree temps no one would get one out during the game.
Did you even bother to read the thread?
Knowing you from past history the answer is no, but figured I’d ask anyway.
Mantle regretted striking out so much, though we has one of the greats anyway. I do not know if even he has a sense if he would have had the same matchless power with less Ks. Someone like him has a great BA on non-Ks (BBIP)-& very good even with them-especially given the era.
“The Giants struck out 1097 times, the Yankees 611, a difference of 486 times.There is only one reason for the Yankees having the better offense.”.
No-brainer Hall of Famer without considering the post season.
Mike, did you see the article(s) where Schilling admitted to taking Toradal? He came out and said it a day after Papelbon said it. I would link the article, but I think if you google it, it will get in your long-term memory faster.
It seems likely to be put internal organs in danger though. Cannot fault guys like him & Koufax for trainers giving it to them to perform. Though that does not mean this particular substance should have been provided.
OK, fine, not the only reason. Primary, probably, but there are certainly others.
No, strikeouts were not even in the top 100 differences between the 1927 Yankees and the 2012 Giants. Holy crap.
Um, having two players combine for more home runs than the 2012 Giants probably accounted for a big chunk of it. That and drawing about 200 more walks and 60 more triples.
But yeah, I’m sure if the Giants had just focused on hacking early in the count and not striking out, they would have scored 1000 runs. Sure. Absolutely.
We can play straw games all day, or look at all the data for the last 25 years, and what we’ll find is that strikeouts tell you less than nothing about how good a team is.
“It’s lazy, it’s been proven wrong time and time again, constantly”.
“Honestly, the middle names of the ballplayers, their siblings, and their pets were probably more meaningful than the number of strikeouts”.
Because I understand regression analysis and you don’t.
“Because I understand regression analysis and you don’t.”.
“This is a baseball conversation dumbass, and you clearly don’t understand that.”.
We can agree that strikeouts aren’t as much of a problem provided the batter hits for power.
112 players struck out 100 times or more.
46 of those players OPSed .800 or more.
Chuck thinks the Braves will win less than 85 games and not make the playoffs based on how often they’ll strikeout.
And frankly, these four options are all about equally likely.
But by-in-large that’s not the argument.
Yes, teams can store a lot of runs when they K a lot.
And they usually are playing golf in mid-October instead of baseball because of it.
The team this year has in essence no leadoff hitter and they are built about as one dimensional as you can be built from top to bottom with almost every hitter in the lineup, aside of McCann, being a swing from the heels K machine.
Cliff Lee is baffled that the Rangers tried to trade Michael Young for the last few years because Young was the heart and soul of the team.
Well, he was also an overpaid, aging player with declining skills with better players on the roster.
What’s he going to say? Certainly not the truth.
Austin Wilson will be sidelined 6-8 weeks with a stress reaction at the top of his elbow.
The speed is there. The fielding instincts are there. He even demonstrated some pop last year. And, personally, I think his heart is there.
…also, you asked Chuck. I’m also curious as to what he’s seen.
I’m confused, was Cliff Lee trying to make a point, because that comment applies almost as much to him as it does to Young.
Yes, John, that’s not a misprint.
Last year, there were six players who hit at least 15 homers and stole at least 30 bases.
Carlos Gomez was one of them. He also had the fewest PA’s.
Now that Nyjer’s gone and Gomez will be the everyday CF and leadoff hitter, I think he’s going to have a big season..All-Star caliber.
I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s in the 25 homer range and close to 50 steals.
“I’m confused, was Cliff Lee trying to make a point, because that comment applies almost as much to him as it does to Young.”.
From May 20th until June 29th Lee had an ERA of 5.68 and opposing batters hit over .300 off of him. During that almost six week stretch, which made up over 25% of his starts in ‘12, he was awful and run support was irrelevant as he put the Phillies back on their heels in start after start.
When he was on he was one of top handful of pitchers in the NL.
He had plenty of fault into why he went 6-9 last year.
Not great like the year before, but the War of 4.2 rather than stellar ’11’s 8.3 seems justified. He deserved a much better record than 6-9, in W-L & decisions.
Ah, he was off for almost 1/2 of the 1st half. I just said that his year was definitely good overall, 127 ERA +, & he easily deserved better than a 6-9 record. In fact, if his suckitude was so concentrated, maybe you would expect a better than normal for his pitching stats W-L record, ’cause he was blown out a lot.
So, are you saying wins and losses matter?
Shouldn’t he be giving up like 2.5 runs per game anyway?
“So, are you saying wins and losses matter?”.
I’m pretty clearly saying they don’t, as a measuring tool for pitchers. Exhibit 1 would be one of the top 5 or so pitchers in the league going 6-9 despite pitching excellently.
“So…why wouldn’t that be enough for a 25 million dollar per year pitcher?
“Well, that’s up to the Phillies to decide, really…but compare his 2012 season with his 2010 season, the one he had right before he signed that contract. Aside from W/L, they’re virtually indistinguishable”.
But sure, if you want to say that’s “indistinguishable” John we can play that game just for you.
He is 32 and will be 33 in July.
Including 2013, has five more years on his contract.
It’s almost a guarantee that he’ll be injured at some point but let’s assume he plays out the contract.
“Why don’t you just stand your ground?”.
Announcing it is like all those people who make statuses about how they are going to close their Facebook accounts.
Talk about a cry for help and sympathy….
To weigh 400 pounds a year after he’s retired? OK, sure.
The only reason this site bothers you is because everyone here is smarter than you.
People who get booted from legitimate sites end up at Bleacher Report, not the other way around.
In case anyone wants to go back and read the comment thread on Shaun’s article, Lefty handed Shaun his lunch and basically made him quit his own site.
That is the ultimate smack-down.
He’s a number three pitching in the number one spot.
He went to his doctor the other day to get his medical clearance for the race and according to his BMI rating of 25.1, he is overweight.
The guy said he was an athlete his whole life and played baseball and ran track at a Division III school in Texas, then moved to Minnesota for a job, got married and got fat because eating is the national sport of cold weather.
Totally, and completely worthless.
If I didn’t know better, I would have thought I’ve just been called a nazi.
Which, isn’t saying much. A number 3 in in the #1 spot is a good way to think about it.
The Tigers are paying Prince Fielder 24 million a year. And they’ve got a long way to go.
Anibal Sanchez is going to be making 16-17 million starting next year.
At around 150 million today, the future Tigers will approach something like 180 million a year. That’s a lot of money for Detroit — a city that is falling apart everywhere you look. I don’t know how they manage it.
What is realistic for him in 2013?
What else is interesting to me….
But everyone (except Lefty) was reserved & kind to Shawn while he was here this time. He did not return the favor. No need for him to take pot shots that way.
But I doubt Mussina makes it on the first try.
I have no idea what he will get. Shot in the dark: 60%.
I’ll give your kidneys a few seconds to stop hurting from laughter.
I thought Law wasn’t a big fan of Montero?
I guess it’s easier to write stupid shit on a site no one reads.
You had to look really hard to find some outrageously bad writing, nowadays all you have to do is turn on the computer.
What I am referring to is the Beyond the Boxscore or the Bleacher Report, sites that will give anyone a user name and free reign to publish whatever bullshit nonsense they want without fear or care of ramifications.
I can’t fathom what has to be in someone’s mind to write something like that, or what the expectations are from it.
Talk to “Felber” directly Raul. You are wrong I do not know what Moose looks like, why would you even float that foolish insult? And instead of actually saying why you believe he is better than Schilling…That does not seem very…confident in your argument nor polite.
I can say that the moon is obviously made of cheese, & you know, folks who are either credulous or do not know better might believe me. Now obviously which of the 2 is better is not so definite & is a matter of opinion, but any premises asserted without evidence carry no persuasive wight nor substance.
You’re still wrong about Moose.
I think a lot of saber guys think they could be the GM of a baseball team.
From a stat perspective there’s not really that much more now than 50 years ago, but the ability to do more with it is where the differences in analysis lies.
The game is still built around scouting and player development, there isn’t one player in the history of professional baseball who was discovered by WAR.
But the smart teams are the ones who “discovered” free agents with analysis and not “oh hey, let’s give Juan fucking Pierre a billion dollars.”.
You want to see Rios because he’s just a great all-around player…at least from a tools perspective.
You probably want to see Konerko because he’ll be standing by the dugout, shootin the sh*t.
Indeed, Connie Mack didn’t win with a lot of teams. He actually has a career losing record.
I hope I’m wrong…but I doubt it.
Hunter Morris is also 0 for spring training. I don’t remember a ball out of the infield and he has like 6 K’s in a dozen or so PA’s.
These are the exact game day press releases that are available in the press box each game.
So, Lefty, when you see something like that, does it give you flashbacks?
And now it appears The A-Rod Family Foundation has only donated 1% of their proceeds to charity.
Elvis Andrus was scratched due to a sore left arm. It was caused by a new tattoo. If he wanted a tattoo, why didn’t he get one in the off-season. Jurickson Profar, come on down.
There you go, cockface Loria. You just got 2 years of your team’s salary paid for 1 player.
But he’s 30. It would be a little insane to offer him an 8-year deal.
er, that’s over the last three years.
@415, of course, because fielding doesn’t matter in baseball.
The difference is that at least now they’re giving them short deals where as George would have locked them up until they were fifty.
I wonder what amount of money the Yankees, their ownership, and fans place on the 2009 World Chamionship.
I don’t know the answers to those questions, but I’m pretty sure 2009 doesn’t happen without both those guys.
What did you mean in post #416?
The National League is screwed.
So why exactly is his 78.1 WAR not roughly commensurate with his real value? WHo else has an appreciably worse WAR who is better or even at least as good?
Why would anyone listen to your opinion on who was better?
They don’t understand baseball well enough to apply their “advanced” stats correctly.
“Nobody has shown I do not know the game well enough to apply advanced stats,”.
Just because someone disagrees with you does not mean they know little about baseball or the question at hand. Insisting that ALL who like advanced metrics, or disagree with you about which guys are not HOFers, is Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
To use the technical term. It is very basic that you can believe different things from higher or lower levels of knowledge & moral evolution. Saying anyone who feels different than you about SM or how good a player is….
That is not an evolved & wise position, & this is structurally so, even if you are RIGHT about some individual cases.
Your comments weren’t the only one deleted, I deleted some of my own as well.
I know you did. None necessary or + to remove. If I was commenting on current matters you would complain I do not know enough-when I remain silent on just some baseball topics you attack me for that. In some ways you have become better.
That’s not why, and you know it, and the comments being deleted reflect that.

You could easily count the many times she had visited him by the blades of grass collected within it. Every Sunday for the last two years, she would kneel at his graveside and ask him to come home with her, just like the little blades of grass. She would carry those tiny symbols of love in her hand until she placed them in the book.
This time, she sat and opened the book up, unclasped her hand and the blade of grass wasn't there. Panicking, she stood up and brushed at her clothing, desperately hoping that it would fall to the floor within her sight, but she saw nothing.
Tears quickly formed in her eyes as she cried his name, "James, James please help me find it!".
She looked frantically for that little blade of grass. She rushed to the bedroom and whipped the pink chenille bedspread onto the floor. She climbed on the bed and began removing her clothes like a mad woman. She shook her blouse and watched the white sheet for one tiny little green stripe to appear.
She shook her skirt, her long brown hair and then her underclothes as she removed them. She saw nothing at all and fell on to the cold sheet, naked, broken hearted and sobbing. She closed her eyes and begged for a few moments, even a kiss on the cheek would have let her know that James still looked down on her from heaven above.
Soon Stacey sat up on the bed and thought out loud, "You really have to quit this foolishness; he is gone, never coming back, ever!".
Still hurting, she grabbed at her green robe from the bedpost and went to run herself a warm bath. She turned on the taps and poured in half a bottle of liquid soap.
The flowery scent of the soap seemed to calm her as she tied up her hair.
Sitting on the edge of the bath with her feet in the water, she dropped the robe from over her shoulders and eased herself slowly into the bubbles.
He would individually name the intimate parts of her body, describing them to her with words like soft, perfect, beautiful and delicious. Stacey wanted James back so badly. She looked down at her soapy knees and remembered the feel of his body brushing against her inner thighs.
Her last tremor was more like a quake. She felt the juices flow from within her as she now collapsed into a satisfaction she hadn't felt in such a long, long time.
Stacey lay there contented now, just soaking and relaxing in the water. She only thought of James. She knew he had just visited her. She held her left hand up and wiped the soap away from off her cheek. Looking down at her wedding ring, she caught glimpse of a little green tip sticking out from underneath the gold.
She gently twisted the ring forward on her finger revealing the full splendour of that single blade of grass. She smiled and said, "I love you so much James, and I know I will meet you again soon enough.".
I guess they just couldn’t realise, there are many manifestations of that wonderful world of undying love.

You know, those assortments of expertly edited clips looking back at who died in the past year, or the ones that sum up each best picture nominee in just a couple of minutes.
Workman used plenty of raisins and plenty of nuts in his montage of the movie Babel when it was nominated for best picture back in 2007. Workman boiled the 143-minute movie down to just two minutes, which he packed with about 50 scenes.
"You're looking for a flow," he says. "What is pushing this thing forward? What is making it happen?".
"In the film community, everyone knows Chuck Workman," Provost says. "As an editor he's kind of a god.".
In fact, one of Provost's favorite movies is Precious Images, for which Workman won a 1987 Oscar. It's a short movie that manages to encompass the history of Hollywood film just by using montage.
"They'd rather have Ellen DeGeneres taking a selfie," he says, with just a bit of a grumble. "What does that have to do with movies?".
Workman has not produced any montages for the Oscars since 2010. It was fun, he says, but he does not miss it. Most recently, he celebrated Hollywood history by directing a 2014 documentary called Magician: The Astonishing Life and Work of Orson Welles.
Getting ready for the Lunar New Year once meant buying a new set of clothes for many families of Korean ancestry.
For centuries, the costume known as hanbok – a two-piece outfit traditionally made of embroidered cotton or silk worn by men and women – has played a central role in the new year's wardrobe.
"Family members would get together in a new set of hanbok and bow to each other in a traditional way, wishing good health and fortune," explains Minjee Kim, a costume historian who has studied hanbok, a style of dress modeled from 17th- and 18th-century daily attire worn during the Joseon Dynasty.
But this Lunar New Year tradition is waning.
While hanbok dresses are still in high demand during wedding season, these days a bride's hanbok dress might be the only one she ever buys. "Young couples today in Korea are not having as many children, so when they all get together for traditional holidays, those gatherings are very small," Kim says. "They don't try to keep their traditions strictly by wearing hanbok.".
Kim adds that the cost of the custom-made outfits, which can run as high as several thousand dollars, has forced many families to scale back from making annual hanbok purchases.
Owner Youjung Jung, 57, opened the store six years ago after emigrating from South Korea. She says she's disappointed that fewer people are keeping the hanbok tradition in her home country and the U.S. Designing and making the outfits have been part of the family business for Jung as far back as her grandmother's generation. But her adult children, she says, have no plans to continue the business.
"It's a problem," she says with her eyes downcast.
Jinhee Kim, who lives in Queens, stopped by to buy a hanbok for the Lunar New Year after picking up her seven-year-old daughter from Korean-language school.
"I want my daughter to follow the Korean tradition. I'm just here for her," Kim says.
Lisa Anderson, who is Korean-American and also lives in Queens, says she is not getting a hanbok of her own for the new year, but she is getting her wardrobe ready for her son's doljanchi, or first birthday celebration.
"I wish that my mother-in-law was still alive, and I wish that my wife had brothers and sisters. But she doesn't. She's an only child. So I think that if we don't maintain it, then it can very well be lost," he says.
Well, host Neil Patrick Harris, our Official Host Of Lots Of Things, for one. He's done the Emmys and the Tonys and probably spends his Sunday nights hosting impromptu awards ceremonies for his family, but this year, he's getting the big stage for the first time.
Meanwhile, we'll be on Twitter, like much of the rest of the world, using the hashtag #NPROscars.
Late last year, a Spanish judge prohibited Uber from operating in Spain, after protests by taxi drivers. Days later, the company announced it was closing down operations here.
But less than two months later, it's reinvented itself as UberEATS, converting its network of drivers into food deliverymen.
Customers in Spain can log onto the same Uber smartphone app which they used to request rides (though they may need to update the app; Spanish telecom operators were ordered to block the original app after a judge's ruling in December). A new option labeled UberEATS allows users to order food from participating restaurants. The service is part of a partnership with the Spanish foodie website Plateselector.
Uber debuted this new service in Barcelona last night, promising food delivery in 10 minutes or less. The company already provides a similar service in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills, called UberFRESH.
Most dishes cost around $11, with about a $3 delivery fee. Just like with the ride-share service, customers with GPS-enabled smartphones can watch a little taxi icon getting closer, delivering their meal.
In addition to Spain, Uber faces ride-share bans in South Korea, Thailand, India and France. It also faces stiff resistance from taxi drivers and unions in Germany, Belgium and elsewhere. In India, Uber was criticized as unsafe after allegations that a woman was raped by her Uber driver. And in Sydney, Australia, the company came under fire for jacking up prices during a hostage crisis.
Nevertheless, the five-year-old San Francisco-based company has expanded to more than 50 countries. Uber is privately-held, but has been valued by investors at more than $40 billion.
Harris Wittels died Thursday. He was a stand-up comic, a television writer/producer, a musician, a frequent and dependably hilarious guest on comedy podcasts, and an author who unleashed the concept of the #humblebrag upon the cultural landscape.
When anyone dies, our sadness is tinged with something darker and more selfish; we resent the time we'll never get to spend with that person, the days and months and years that will pile up without their presence.
When a comedian dies, particularly one so young, we feel that resentment more keenly, because laughter is a limited resource - one of a very few things with the power to make those days and months and years pass more easily.
On Twitter, you can read some of his fellow comics weighing in on his stand-up and his music (with the band Don't Stop or We'll Die, formed with Paul Rust and Michael Cassady) while his fellow Parks and Recreation writers laud his singular contributions to that show. (By the way: You know Harris, Pawnee's Animal Control guy? That was him.).
But you and me, let's talk podcasts.
I've used the word "affection" twice in the last two paragraphs, because that's the word that came through most clearly in every Wittels appearance: the guy was loved. You can hear it.
Here's a thing about podcasts – their loose, rangy, long-form format breeds a distinctive strain of intimacy. You're listening to a conversation between two or more people, with all the digressions and hoary jokes their shared history engenders, and if feels familiar, comfortable, warm.
It's a conversation that clocks in at an hour and forty minutes. It would never fit into the programmatic confines of radio or television; it flows, it doubles back, it halts, it lurches forward. It's a weird gift, is what it is.
Wittels is gone, and that's sad. Infuriatingly so. There's that familiar resentment – he was only 30 years old, which means we won't get decades and decades of his comedy.
So while mourning his absence, maybe spend some time today, and in the days and months and years to come, enjoying his digital presence.
"We continue to cooperate with and voluntarily respond to the information requests from the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office," Humana wrote.
The privately run Medicare Advantage plans offer seniors an alternative to standard Medicare, which pays doctors for each service they render. By contrast, under Medicare Advantage, the health plans are paid a set fee monthly for each patient based on a complex formula known as a risk score. Essentially, the government pays higher rates for sicker patients and less for those in good health.
But overcharges related to inflated risk scores, intentional or not, have cost taxpayers billions of dollars in recent years, as the Center for Public Integrity reported in a series published last year.
But Humana's financial disclosure offers fresh details into the wide scope of the Justice review, indicating it is taking aim at a range of common Medicare Advantage billing practices and fraud controls, as well as Humana's use of home health assessments of patients in its plans. The industry argues these "house calls" improve the health of elderly patients, but federal officials have been concerned that the primary objective is to raise risk scores and revenues.
The government probe comes at an inopportune time for the burgeoning Medicare Advantage industry, which is mounting an intense lobbying and advocacy effort to stave off proposed government funding cuts.
What will happen to the rates is not yet clear. But the Obama administration's 2016 budget seeks to cut some $36 billion from Medicare Advantage plans over the next decade related to oversized risk scores.
Allegations that some Medicare Advantage plans manipulate risk scores, a process known in the industry as "upcoding," have been surfacing over the past year in the federal courts.
Humana has been a major promoter of these home assessments. In an email to the Center today, Noland wrote: "We believe in continuing to do in-home assessments as we see this as an important step in establishing care management plans for our members living with multiple chronic conditions.".
Noland declined to say how many of the home assessments Humana has performed. But the company has previously said that it conducted the assessments for about 531,000 members in the first three months of 2014.
A member of Canada's House of Commons has earned laughs and toasts from his colleagues, after he blamed his absence during a vote on tight underwear that makes him uncomfortable.
MP Pat Martin of Winnipeg Centre gave the explanation to foil an attempt to have his vote thrown out because, contrary to parliamentary rules, he had left his seat during the voting process.
"I can blame it on a sale that was down at the Hudson's Bay [store]," Martin announced. "They had men's underwear on for half price. I bought a bunch that was clearly too small for me. I find it difficult to sit for any length of time, Mr. Speaker.".
Maintaining a deadpan delivery even as howls of laughter began, Martin added, "I apologize if it was necessary for me to leave my seat briefly, but I did not mean to forfeit my right to vote.".
The incident touched off a round of jokes on Twitter. Our friends at the CBC have collected some of the best comments.
Recounting the events, Comartin acknowledged that Martin had left his seat and that he had instructed the member to return to his chair.
"I didn't understand the explanation at the time, that he subsequently gave," he added. "Can't say I really understand it at this point.".
When Martin spoke to the CBC about the incident later Thursday, he suggested that his story wasn't entirely serious, and that he was trying to quash what he called an "overreaction" by a member of a rival party.
"I believe that his point of order was tongue in cheek and it warranted a cheeky response," Martin said.
While he admitted that a half-off sale is like "catnip to a Winnipegger," the lawmaker also wondered whether "a lot of the grumpiness in the House of Commons might be traced to the fact that MPs are buying one size too small in their knickers.".
It's been 10 years since we launched the annual Hollywood Jobs series, in which we explore odd movie jobs — you know, the ones you see in the closing credits. In the last decade, producer Cindy Carpien and I have talked to key grips, animal wranglers, focus pullers, foley artists, shoemakers, slate operators, loopers, food stylists and many more. Today we check back with some folks we've profiled in the past, to ask how their jobs have changed since we last met.
Our first stop is Santa Monica studio of award-winning costume designer Julie Weiss (she did Frida, American Beauty, Blades of Glory). On Sunday you'll see her work in the Oscar musical numbers. Weiss says the major change in her job is the way computers have affected her day. "If I go to an interview I don't take all those sketches," she says, "They're on the screen.".
It's nice to have less to schlep, but the technology comes with a price — she says it's harder to show off a fabric on a screen.
As movies have moved out of town Weiss has taken on a wider variety of work; she now does theater, TV, even video games. "I want to be a good storyteller and if it means that that's what it takes to be there — I'm there," she says.
"A film — it should be seen on a screen," she says. "You should be able to witness it at the same proportion or bigger than life. ... I guess maybe it would make the job a little easier — I wouldn't have to worry about if the third button matched — but I don't want to do it that way.".
The last time we saw Doug Dresser, he'd taken us to an abandoned hospital morgue. Today we find him in Pacific Palisades, overlooking the ocean. Dresser is a location scout — one of the first folks hired on a film — to hunt down places where the cameras will roll.
"Ten years ago, they used to make movies in Los Angeles," Dresser says. "Right now, you can count on one hand the amount of feature films they're making here.".
The travel takes a toll; Dresser has two young children and he wants to watch them grow up. And it isn't just his kids who notice he's gone, he says: "After I came back [shooting] in North Carolina ... my dry cleaner asked me, 'Where have you been? I haven't seen you in a very long time — did you go to another drycleaner?'".
Dresser misses the old feature film days. "There's nothing better" he says, than "being able to start from a blank page and helping craft the look of a movie.".
Artisans still had to paint the gun to look antique, but the 3-D printer lets the prop master duplicate the gun easily. "We made two of them," Glenn says. "Because with an action prop, if it breaks ... you lose a day of shooting." The gun isn't on screen for more than a few seconds but each one cost about $20,000.
The 3-D printer can re-work gun parts on quick demand, and Glenn says that's a real change. "Before, we would have had a sculptor, who worked for weeks and weeks," she says.
Casting director Margie Simkin says technology has had a major effect on the way she does her job. A decade ago she had to sift through piles and piles of 8x10 headshots that arrived in the mail every day. By 2008, that mail deluge had begun to subside — again, the influence of computers.
"We put out a call, which you do online, and said we were looking for someone to do a few lines, two days' work, and within hours we got 1,100 submissions," she says.
And that was just actors in Los Angeles. Now, it's global. All over the world, performers hit a button, record themselves, send off the file — and hope. It's efficient but also exhausting for the casting director on the other end.
"I sort of sit there at night, sometimes in bed, and go through thousands of submissions," Simkin says.
In what is being described as an unprecedented occurrence, Australia is getting slammed by two major cyclones at the same time.
"Emergency services scrambled to evacuate thousands of homes before pulling out and warning anyone who had not left to barricade themselves inside," the news agency reported.
According to the BBC, the mayor of Rockhampton says the town is in lockdown.
"Yeppoon was the only populated area that took the brunt of Marcia at its most powerful, with the cyclone weakening to a category three by the time it reached the city of Rockhampton, which nevertheless also suffered widespread wind damage, flash flooding and power outages.".
It's said that every writer spends his or her entire life working on a single poem or one story. Figuratively, of course, this means that writers are each possessed by a certain obsession. As such, their entire body of work, in one way or another, is generally an attempt to dimension some part of that obsession, ask questions about it, answer them, and then ask many new questions.
Now it can take up to two weeks to berth the enormous cargo ships, thanks to contract disputes between the shipping lines and the union representing 20,000 dockworkers. About 50 cargo ships are anchored offshore, waiting to be unloaded.
"Ships are just stuck doing nothing, they're just losing money and at the same time schedules are going to pot," says Janet Porter, an editor with Lloyds List, a shipping industry news provider.
"And then about 3 months ago when the slowdown began, and ships became significantly delayed, then we saw another round of diversion to Canadian ports, to Vancouver and Prince Rupert," he says.
Brown says the U.S. East Coast ports are very busy with ships coming in from Asia via the Suez Canal. He says it take a bit longer in terms of sailing distance. Also, freight rates — the cost to ship a container — are now higher on the East Coast because of the demand.
"But in terms of the costs that are being incurred in the delays, that additional freight rate doesn't seem to be the issue, it's more one of trying to get some sort of reliability out of the supply chain," he says.
Timothy Simpson, a communications director with shipping giant, Maersk Line, says shipping companies have to try to take in every variable, such a bad weather or work slowdowns, that could affect the supply chain. He says it can be a guessing game.
"You have to look at what's happening today and how we're going to adjust. you know that's really the best way that we found to manage it," he says.
Still, Simpson says Maersk Line has a team that meets daily to review all those variables that can affect the shipping industry.
After Sept. 11, President George Bush made a speech about America's enemies — Iran, Iraq and North Korea — in which he referred to them as the "Axis of Evil." At first, that name worried Iranian-American comedian Maz Jobrani. But then he decided to do what he always does: laugh about it. He and some friends even started the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour, which featured comedians of Middle-Eastern descent.

Read an excerpt of I'm Not A Terrorist, But I've Played One On TV.
Patel had been in the U.S. for a couple of weeks to help with a new grandson in Madison, a suburb of Huntsville in northern Alabama, when he was stopped by two officers responding to a call about suspicious activity.
The police video reveals a language barrier.
"He don't speak a lick of English," an officer says, complaining that Patel was walking away. Patel's arms are then restrained behind his back, and Madison policeman Eric Parker slams Patel to the ground, face down. He was hospitalized earlier this month with a spinal cord injury and is undergoing rehabilitation.
"Please accept our sincere apology to your government, Mr. Patel and the citizens of India who reside and work in our state," he wrote.
Patel's lawyer, Hank Sherrod, says the family is grateful for the Indian government's support, and welcomed the governor's response.
"They really appreciate the governor making such a public apology," he said.
"I don't want to blame that person for making that call. But I do want to say that people have to know their neighbors — get around, meet them, see what they are about, learn their culture," he says. "That's what should come out of this incident.".
Now This Is An Example Of Truly Educational Radio.
Every day, 17-year-old Kaday goes to school by turning on the radio.
She's one of the million school-age children in Sierra Leone who've had no classroom to go to since July. That's when the government closed all schools to curb the spread of Ebola.
But that doesn't mean the kids have stopped learning. In October, the government launched a radio education program, partnering with UNICEF and several development organizations. Teachers write and record hourlong lessons that are broadcast on 41 government radio stations, as well as the country's only TV channel. Younger children listen in the morning; older ones tune in during the afternoon and evening.
"This is to ensure that children's rights to education is not disrupted even when schools have been closed," says Wongani Grace Taulo, UNICEF's education chief in Sierra Leone. "It's been more than half a year of school closure. The implications can be devastating when children just stay home [and] lose out on their academic gains.".
UNICEF's partner organizations visit around 2,000 households of school-age children each week to see how many children are listening. At first, fewer than 20 percent were tuned in. Gradually the numbers picked up. At its peak, more than 70 percent of students were listening. The average rate, Taulo says, is about 50 percent.
The radio lessons could be critical in a country where the decade-long civil war had weakened the education system even before Ebola struck. Fewer than 45 percent of adults are literate, and the secondary school attendance rate among adolescent boys and girls is 40 and 33 percent, respectively. The Ebola outbreak has threatened to reverse any progress Sierra Leone and its neighbors Guinea and Liberia have made in rebuilding its schools.
Angela Kamara, 6 years old, takes a lesson from the radio.
When schools finally reopen in Sierra Leone, Taulo adds, the radio program will be adjusted to serve as a complement — rather than an alternative — to classrooms.
But school by radio isn't a perfect solution.
Radio is by far the most common way Sierra Leoneans get their information, with studies estimating that between 70 and 90 percent of the population tune in daily. But the number of people who actually own a radio is only about 25 percent, the country's education minister told Agence France-Presse.
And that's a "generous estimate," says Chernor Bah, a girl's rights advocate from Sierra Leone. He's been helping make sure the radio program reaches as many underserved children as possible.
"With adolescent girls, there's an even greater challenge," he says. "Girls tend to face the additional burden of providing for their families. So instead of being home listening to the radio, most girls will be outside selling food.".
Even if students do listen, says Bah, the radio program doesn't give them a chance to interact with teachers and other students. The government encourages students to send questions via text message, but many of the poorest students can't afford a phone.
That's where organizations like BRAC, one of the world's largest education organizations, have stepped in. With support from the Malala Fund, the nonprofit has bought radios for 1,200 of the most marginalized girls in Sierra Leone. It's also created 40 informal classrooms, where six or seven girls get together with a mentor up to four times a week to discuss the day's lessons, learn about Ebola and discuss personal challenges.
School may not be in session, but there are special clubs for girls to talk about their radio lessons and just have fun hanging out.
"This girl, now 17, is only in grade six because of all this back and forth," Bah recalls. "The [school club] is the place she feels normal again.".
Kaday had just taken her sixth-grade exam when schools shut down. All she wants, Bah says, is to go back to class. "You don't forget a girl like that.".
The restaurant economy of New York City may be nearing a tipping point.
State officials are recommending a big hike in the minimum hourly wage for people who work for tips. But that idea is giving many restaurateurs indigestion in New York City, home to more than 20,000 restaurants. Some say a tipped wage hike could upend the whole system of tipping.
And many servers say tips are the No. 1 reason why they started waiting tables.
"You need money, OK? Waiting tables has always been a job where you can rapidly start making money," says Steve Dublanica, a former waiter who now writes a blog called Waiter Rant.
After 23 Years, Your Waiter Is Ready For A Raise.
The federal tipped minimum wage is $2.13, but New York state's is higher: $5 an hour. The wage board wants to raise that to $7.50 at the end of the year. And as you might expect, restaurants are not happy about this proposal.
"I don't know of any place ever that's increased a minimum wage or a tipped wage by 50 percent," says Melissa Fleischut, president of the New York State Restaurant Association. "I just think it's unheard of.".
Actually, the wage hike would be smaller for servers who already earn more than minimum wage if you count their tips. In New York City, many servers make way above minimum wage anyway, but restaurateurs still say this change would mean a serious jump in their labor costs in an industry where margins are thin.
"It's a matter of life and death," says Philippe Massoud, the executive chef of ilili, a Lebanese restaurant in Manhattan.
He says he thinks the hourly increase could have major unintended consequences for the industry.
Other restaurateurs say they're considering getting rid of tipping altogether and just paying waiters by the hour. To do that, the restaurant would have to collect a lot more money from the dining public, probably in the form of a service charge or higher menu prices.
As The Salt has reported, a few restaurants around the country are experimenting with this higher hourly wage, no-tip model. And just this month, New York City's Dirt Candy, an acclaimed vegetarian restaurant, reopened with a no-tip policy: Instead of a service charge, its bills now include a 20 percent mandatory administrative fee that goes toward the salary of all restaurant employees.
"If this happens, we will, in all likelihood, go to a service charge model that's used in Europe," says Jimmy Haber, CEO of ESquared Hospitality, which operates more than a dozen restaurants, including BLT Prime in New York. "We'll pay our front-of-house employees a fixed hourly wage, which means that we're going to have to work them a lot less hours.".
There are a handful of restaurants in the U.S. that already pay their servers higher hourly wages and benefits. But mostly, they're at the very high end, including Michelin-starred places like Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., or Per Se in New York. Experts are skeptical that this is going to catch on widely because no restaurant wants to suddenly jack up its prices by 20 percent.
"Customers will look at the menu price, and because it's higher, they'll think you're more expensive," says Michael Lynn, who teaches at Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration.
"If you could somehow work things out, where everyone was equitably compensated and got what they needed to live a human life, and the employers made enough money to stay happy, I'd be all for that," he says. "But I've got news for you: That's not going to happen.".
Right now, New York's commissioner of labor is considering the wage board's recommendations. He's expected to decide on them soon.
As the 500-year-old bell tower tolls, about 25 students from the University of Oxford cross a medieval cobblestone street. They duck under a stone archway and slip into a room named after T.S. Eliot, who studied here a century ago.
The students drop their backpacks and get ready for practice. They're here to hone their tongues. This week, an elite team of Oxford's six best tasters will battle the University of Cambridge to see which group has the most refined palate.
In the back of the Oxford practice room, the coach, Hanneke Wilson, is setting things up. She's published a book about wine. She oversees a wine cellar. And right now, she's struggling to uncork a few bottles.
Oxford and Cambridge have academic awards to see which school is smarter, and boat races to determine which is stronger. And for the past half-century, their blind wine tasting societies have held competitions. It's all part of an epic rivalry that dates back to the 13th century.
Now, these tasting teams are hoping to be recognized as an official sport.
Basically, you need to know what grape, from when and from where — the more specific, the better. This means your tongue needs to have a database of wine. Plus, it helps to have a good working knowledge of agricultural practices and winemaking techniques.
"Wine tasting, as you will by now have realized, is very difficult," coach Wilson says.
Early in the morning on their big day, the team will head over to the train station. Ren Lim, a doctoral student in biophysics, has made this trip three times to represent Oxford. He says that on the train there is a scramble to find seats together. Then they pop open a bottle, cover the label and do a quick practice session right there.
Most Of Us Just Can't Taste The Nuances In High-Priced Wines.
When people ask him about why he devotes so much time to blind wine tasting, Ren Lim says, "I still struggle to find why.".
It is fun and challenging, he admits. And of course, college kids will be college kids.
Coach Wilson says that in more than 20 years of coaching, she's noticed that "Cambridge always makes more noise slurping and spitting than we do. We think they do this to put us off our stride.".
But there's one thing both of these teams agree on.
"We treat wine tasting as a sport," Wilson says. "We train for it, the way we train for a competitive sports match.".
She says both Oxford and Cambridge have petitioned to become officially recognized as sports teams. After all, it worked for chess. But so far, the powers that be haven't been persuaded.
"They think that sport involves running around and kicking or hitting things. We disagree, but there you are," Wilson says with a sigh.
Still, other universities are catching on. Blind tasting has spread around the U.K., and it's even crossed the pond. Both Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania's business schools have teams, among others. They let spectators watch — and taste for themselves.
Here in Oxford, competitions still happen behind closed doors.
"Cherries on the palate. Of course it's a dry wine," Tarkowski looks down at his notes. "I definitely thought it was Italian." Then, he decides to hazard a guess.
When the sock comes off, Tarkowski has guessed right — full marks. It's been a good practice.
2014 Midterm Election Was The Most Expensive One Yet.
As the presidential hopefuls chase after big donors, the Center for Responsive Politics brings us a quick look in the rearview mirror:.
The 2014 congressional midterm elections cost $3.77 billion, the center says, making them (no surprise here) the most expensive midterms yet. CRP also reports that those dollars appeared to come from a smaller cadre of donors — 773,582, the center says. That's about 5 percent fewer than in the 2010 midterms.
CRP found that the average contribution swelled from $1,800 in 2010, to slightly more than $8,000 in 2014. That appears to reflect the growth of superPACs, political committees created by the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling and other court decisions earlier in 2010. SuperPACs disclose their donors but have no contribution limits.
Overall, CRP found that Republican candidates, party committees and outside groups spent $1.77 billion, about $44 million more than Democrats.
This time, they're through. Done. They're walking out the door on Friday.
Unless they aren't. Unless they renew their vows and their union grows ever closer.
That's basically where Greek officials and European finance ministers are in their complicated relationship. After years of possible-breakup drama, a real deadline will arrive Friday and the parties must decide: Are we in this thing together or not?
If Greece tells Europe, in effect: "Fine. Walk away. Russia will love us instead," then Europe — and the United States — may have a whole new set of economic and geopolitical problems to worry about.
There were hints Tuesday that Greece is moving toward saying: "Wait! Let's talk. I know we can work it out." Those positive rumors kept European financial markets calm — for now.
But economists say real stability will come only when the hints and rumors have been turned into a clear proposal.
This fraught relationship has been having its ups and downs for so long, you may have stopped paying attention. To help you catch up, here's a 1-2-3 recap, and a look-ahead to Friday:.
1) Greece is a small country with a big problem; for years, it was spending too much. So the government had been borrowing a lot, and finally could not meet its debt obligations when the global recession hit.
2) But Greece is not a stand-alone country, free to default on debt or devalue its currency. It's part of the European Union, and uses the euro. Europeans did not want one of their members to tumble into financial chaos.
3) So in 2012, EU finance ministers helped cobble together a plan to bail out Greek debt in exchange for the country raising taxes while cutting wages, pensions, public investment and social security benefits.
The timing of his election was, shall we say, awkward because on March 1, Greece's credit lines will expire.
Europe's finance ministers met Monday. They had hoped to come up with an extension of the bailout package — with its attached austerity strings.
Negotiations broke down. Afterwards, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis told reporters: "In the history of the European Union, nothing good has ever come out of ultimatums.".
But there's little time left. Friday is the real deadline because national parliaments need time to ratify any deal before the Feb. 28 expiration of the existing bailout.
Speculation had been swirling that Greece might turn to Russia or China for help. That would be a bad outcome from the perspective of U.S. and European officials, who do not want Greece to: grow distant from Europe; pull out of the euro currency union; or default on its debts.
Any of that could shake up financial markets. There's been more than a hint of jitters in the banking sector: Greek banks reportedly have been losing deposits at the rate of 2 billion euros ($2.27 billion) a week.
IHS Global Insight, a forecasting firm, issued an assessment Tuesday morning saying that failure to reach an agreement could cause turmoil in Greece, bringing "a re-emergence of wide-scale protests, riots and labour strikes, which would cause disruption to businesses.".
But on Tuesday afternoon, The Wall Street Journal quoted an unnamed source saying Greece will try to escape such turmoil by asking for a temporary credit extension of up to six months. So maybe, once again, there will be no clear resolution, just another agreement to keep living together — for now.
On what happens when there's a public outcry against police.
My thoughts go to two places: One is that when cops are attacked, they close ranks. I'm not talking about the blue wall of silence, but I think what happens is "us versus them." I'm talking about incidents which the cops — like [in] Ferguson where an unarmed man was shot, when they get under attack with the media, they just close ranks. It's like buffalo when they see lions out there. ...
The Federal Aviation Administration has released long-awaited draft rules on the operation of pilotless drones, opening the nation's airspace to the commercial possibilities of the burgeoning technology, but not without restrictions.
In short, the proposed rules that have been a decade in the making would limit drones weighing no more than 55 lbs to flying no more than 100 mph at an altitude no higher than 500 feet. The FAA would ban their use at night and near airports. And, they could only be operated by someone with a certification who keeps the vehicle "in line of sight" at all times.
The FAA also will require anyone using Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) for commercial purposes to obtain a special pilot certification to operate them.
"We ... want to capture the potential of unmanned aircraft and we have been working to develop the framework for the safe integration of this technology into our airspace," Department of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said during a teleconference with journalists about the new proposed rules.
Under the rules, these aircraft could inspect utility towers, antennas, bridges power lines and pipelines in hilly or mountainous terrain," FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said, adding that wildlife conservation, search and rescue, movie making and aerial photographs for real estate purposes were also among the opportunities that could be opened up by the new regulations.
In a statement, the White House called drones "a potentially transformative technology in diverse fields such as agriculture, law enforcement, coastal security, military training, search and rescue, first responder medical support, critical infrastructure inspection, and many others.".
The statement says that the proposed rules ensure "that the Federal Government's use of UAS takes into account ... important concerns and in service of them, promotes better accountability and transparent use of this technology.".
Even so, the news agency says, "the rule was unlikely to help Amazon.com in its quest to deliver packages with unmanned drones, since its approach requires an FAA-certified small drone pilot to fly the aircraft and keep it line of sight at all times — factors not envisioned in the online retailer's plan.".
The draft regulations must still undergo public comment and revision before being officially adopted.
But, Guliani says, it "falls short of fully protecting the privacy of Americans.
"For example, the proposal allows the use of data gathered by domestic drones for any 'authorized purpose,' which is not defined, leaving the door open to inappropriate drone use by federal agencies," she says.
The headquarters of the National Oil Corporation in Tripoli are gleaming, the floors marble, the offices decked out with black leather chairs and fake flowers. It seems far from the fighting going on over oil terminals around the country.
But the man in charge looks at production and knows the future is bleak.
He looks like a typical executive, decked out in a suit and glasses. But beneath his calm veneer, he's worried.
"Now we have two problems: low production and low price," he says.
At the current rate, he expects that the country won't even earn 10 percent of the budget money Libya had in 2012, before militias started taking oil infrastructure hostage.
"If there is security in Libya, we can resume production within a few days," Sanallah says.
The international community has recognized the eastern government, but it opposes what it sees as the east's divisive attempt to set up a rival national oil company and take control of the industry, something Sanallah says is impossible anyway.
International mediators are trying to keep the oil company independent of either side, but oil fields are under attack. One tanker was bombed, and another one was threatened.
Sanallah says he wants to keep oil out of the fight.
His employees are fighting fires at major oil terminals, and with no real security forces, it only takes a few gunmen to shut things down or hold them hostage.
"I think the message was clear to the oil company: There is no security, good security. Otherwise a few people cannot control the vein of the blood of Libya," he says.
And with the terminals closing, Libya's battered economy is taking even more blows because foreign oil companies are pulling out. Libya is only producing about 330,000 barrels a day, increasing the economic burden.
Again, oil is basically what pays for any central Libyan government. How much? "All — 90 to 95 percent. There is no revenue but oil," he says.
If negotiations don't end the fighting, Sanallah says, the country will collapse. A functioning oil industry could be all that stands between Libya as a nation, and Libya as a failed state.
Lonely Planet named Singapore its top country destination for 2015. An island known as a little red dot on the world map, Singapore has less than 5.5 million people.
But when it comes to tourism, Singapore punches above its weight, with nearly 14 million tourists visiting the island in the first eleven months of 2014. And as a result of a long-term plan by the Singapore government, many of them come for the food.
You can find many versions of chicken rice, considered one of Singapore's national dishes, which features steamed or blanched white bird meat. You can also find chili crab, a well-loved seafood dish stir-fried in a tomato and chili-based sauce, and rojak, fried dough that has been grilled over charcoal.
When the government of Singapore decided to make culinary training a centerpiece of its plan to turn the island into a world-class tourist destination, it invited the Culinary Institute of America to open its first international branch on the island. Four years ago, Managing Director Eve Felder moved to Singapore with her family to set up the program — around the same time that celebrity chefs like Wolfgang Puck and Mario Batali also arrived.
Felder says the culinary institute's Singapore program features the same curriculum as its other branches in the U.S., which teach students to prepare classical cuisine in the European tradition. The basic techniques used in preparing world-class cuisine are the same whether you're making a beef bourguignon or a curry, she says.
"Part of our being here is to professionalize and teach the whys of cooking, so it's not haphazard," Felder says." The whys are all the same. The difference is in the flavor profiles.".
Jodin says his parents were not happy with his choice to become a chef rather than a doctor or lawyer, because they worried he wouldn't earn enough in the kitchen. "They were very concerned," he says. "And it's a very Asian culture kind of thing. They want you to get good jobs.".
But these days, some of the best jobs in Singapore are in the restaurant industry, according to Ryan Clift, who owns the Tippling Club. "This is a career where you will never be unemployed for the rest of your life. It's a universal language. It's food. It's cooking, you know.".
Clift has been cooking since he was 13. He used to run a restaurant in Australia and opened the Tippling Club here in 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis, managing to stay in business by selling a lot of what he called "FU-the Subprime Cocktail" for $100 each — a drink that he says was big enough to share among several people.
Now, Clift prepares meals that consist of modernist gastronomy dishes, such as edible charcoal and peppers that look like hot coals. Some of those meals can cost $5,000 for a 32-course dinner that serves up to 12 people. He says at least 45 percent of his bookings each night are international guests who come for one reason: "They are flying here as gastro tourists, and they are coming here just to eat.".
The way Felder puts it, "We teach them how to make people's dreams come true. A kitchen is high pressure. It's hot. Your hands smell like shrimp or whatever. But you must do it with grace. It is grace under pressure.".
Singapore hopes that grace under pressure and skills in the kitchen will help make it the gastronomic gateway to Asia.

“We knew that it’s illegal to take ‘raw’ corals from Thailand, but not souvenirs made of corals and seashells. That’s why we were sure that there was nothing illegal as we had bought the corals here,” she said.
However, Ms Karmanova explained, “But since we though that we could take out the shells that we had bought here, we did not worry much.”.
“The next day we tried to clean them (the corals and shells) with the cleaning agent so that the owner of the hotel would not worry that they would smell,” Ms Karmanova added.
The women planned to take them back to the beach and throw them back into the water later anyway, Ms Karmanova said.
After dealing with the landlady’s concerns, the women went out and returned to their bungalow later only to learn about the police visit, after which the two women voluntarily presented themselves at Karon Police Station, where they were placed under arrest, Ms Karmanova said, clarifying how the pair came to be taken into custody.
After their release on bail, the pair returned to the bungalow and talked to the “hotel owner”, who accepted their apologies and said she might have gone too far calling the police, said the NGS report.
Ms Karmanova and Ms Likman are expected to have their case heard in court within 48 days.
In the meantime their passports are being held by authorities so they cannot leave the country, as is standard procedure as foreigners are usually deemed a flight risk in any criminal charges.
In addition to fear of going to prison, Ms Karmonova is worried about her university studies, as she will need to prove why she has been unable to attend classes, reported NGS.
Further, Ms Polina’s father claims that both families have had to take out bank loans in order to cover all legal expenses and rising costs of the two students’ forced extended stay in Thailand.
Not every society, take Australia for example vast majority of it's  citizens take personal responsibility for their environment unlike Thailand,  environmental laws are strictly enforced but fair and it shows as the environment there is as good as it gets, you won't see any rubbish, fish stocks are plentiful, no raw sewage leaking directly onto beachfront etc.
Why on earth would you discriminate in law? As a theory, a gram of heroin should be treated as a misdemeanor (whatever that means). So if the environment is long past help, why bother trying to save it or have laws to try and save it? Obviously the science is against that crazy notion.
Agree the environment is long past help, and these women are being scapegoated. The amount of coral (do shells count?) shown in the picture should be treated as a misdemeanor. Change the law to a more sensible and appropriate response that can differentiate between.
Every society one cares to look at does exactly the same thing.
It's all very well saying it's a "gouge." What pearl of wisdom would one offer to a concerned citizen who wants to reports any offence?
If only people would read the act then try think outside of their tiny little square.
This case has very little, if anything, to do with environmental protection.  The damage has been done, with nearly all coral reefs along the west coast being dead and crumbling do to abuse, neglect and illegal discharges, which continue to this day, thus preventing new coral growth. This case is a gouge, and will do more to harm tourism than it will to protect natural resources.
Gotta laugh at the crazies on here. First they moan and groan about nothing being done about the environment, but still moan and groan when something is done. So the corollary by the PN crazies is that an enforcement of any law anywhere is obscene.
An obscene application of a law, and to what end?  Hope they got a receipt for that outrageous bail amount.
Look at what is on that blue plate!
Here they are good in making big issues of small matters, and ripping off tourists.
But when it comes to big matters than they are hopeless, don't know what to do, talk nonsense and walk around it....
Got to say this is much ado about nothing.  Ugly-ass corals and shells, and chunks of this stuff are all over the place, thanks to all the dead coral reefs that have been killed by locals.  I also don't believe their story, nor the fact that they were going to return them to the sea...hogwash.  Lastly, the Thai landlord is a nosy busy-body and a troublemaker. This whole case is harmful to Phuk...
That was 2015! Looking back at the best-read stories of last year.

Even if "Sabbath" s sound has been revised throughout the years, this is not a bad album.
To be honest, the energetic "Hard Life To Live" is another one of the highlights (total three). Savage riff, upbeat and very aggressive rhythmic section (but what's the role of Bevan in here). A very strong song.
Some weak number as well. More on the AOR side (which is not my cup of tea) for "The Shining" and as well as "Glory Ride" (even the master and his solo won't be able this time to rescue this poor song). "Nightmare" being a heavy-metal and uninspired track.
I also wonder what's the role of Geoff Nicholls here since the keys are almost unexistant in this album (or at least so discrete that they are unheard except during "Ancient Warrior). There is absolutely no relation with prog in this album (except the two "Scarlet" minutes). But this is no surprise. This situation lasts for about seventeen years (more to come). IMO, the best two numbers sit at the end of the album.
It is difficult to say that this is a good album. Five out of ten which is maybe more than what could be expected. Two stars.
I fully recognize that many progressive rock fans will not find The Eternal Idol progressive enough. But everything about this album is very tasteful, from the cover art to the music to the production. Despite having this album for several years, I noticed now for the first time that it was (co-) produced by Jeff Glixman who is famous for producing many of Kansas' best albums.
This is a hidden gem from one of my eternal idols!
The production is much better than on the weak Seventh Star album. This is an eighties production but it´s one of the better ones for sure.
The Eternal Idol is a welcome return to form and while it doesn´t really reach the heights of the Dio albums by Black Sabbath, it´s the fans of those albums that will find most of interest here IMO. 3 stars are well deserved. A nice surprise.
Sabbath had been going through a difficult period through the 80's after Dio had left, with some really poor releases, changing line-ups again and again, none which were worthwhile for hardcore Sabbath fans. However, when Tony & Co hired Tony Martin on vocals, the band seemed to be again in shape for dark, semi-gloomy, heavy music.
I can't find a weak hard rock/metal tune in here, they all feature pretty good riffs, some of them with that ol' gloomy aspect that characterized the 70's Sabbath so much, also there's that heavy drumming I mentioned before, from ex-Kiss drummer, Eric Singer, as well as some pretty good guitar solos, though by no means as memorable as those from the 70's Tony did.
I would describe the remainder of the album as commercial and slightly metalized power blues. I admit I really didn't like much of it 20 years ago but after digging up this CD for the review, it amazed me how high the quality actually is. I usually cringe away from stuff like this but here it is hard to ignore the powerful performance and the inspired song writing. A certain blues highlight is Nightmare, while Hard Life to Love, Glory Ride and Born to Lose are all very enjoyable 80's hair metal tracks.

You could try incorporating some of the study’s words in your username, dating profile headline, and bio. Of course, if these words don’t apply to you, don’t use them. We’re not trying to promote lying — it’s always better to be honest.
This isn’t a rule, but think about incorporating some words into your profile that studies have proven attract singles online.
eHarmony also says that there are some words that might be worth avoiding — like sweet, energetic, and modest for men and good listener, rational, and dependable for women. This isn’t a hard-and-fast rule — take it with a grain of salt. We’re just trying to get you to think carefully about your word choice and how you describe yourself.
2. Keep It Relatively Short, But Be Specific About Yourself.
The Write Practice has a lot of great tips for writing succinctly, and we also delve more deeply into this topic here.
Repeat after me: Bathroom selfies have no place in a dating profile. We also suggest not using photos that are blurry, dark, blocking your face, heavily photoshopped, or that are of you with a group (how will people know which one you are?). Online daters will look at your photos before anything else, so they’ve got to be good and varied.
Adding a couple of pictures of you in the same place and/or outfit won’t do you any good.
Basically, the key is to add as many different kinds of pictures to your profile as you can, so people can get an idea of what you like to do. In this article, we provide numerous examples of the best dating profile photos.
4. 70% Should Be About Who You Are & 30% About What You Like.
I hate saying someone’s a Negative Nancy because it leaves out the men, so I like to give equal attention to both genders by saying someone is a Negative Nancy/Nathan. Anyway, my point is positivity is one of the most irresistible qualities a person can possess, and being positive in your dating profile will make people want to get to know more about you.
6. Whatever Kind of Humor You Have, Let It Shine Through.
Spelling mistakes and using improper grammar is the number one worst thing you can do in your dating profile, especially if you’re a guy. In fact, Grammarly, a writing-enhancement platform, says men with just two typos in their profiles are 14% less likely to receive a positive response from women than are men who don’t have any typos in their profiles.
It’s worth taking some time to double-, triple-, and quadruple-check your profile before posting it. If you’re not the best at writing or editing, have a family member, friend, or coworker who is look it over. You can also use a grammar and spell-check tool — there are a lot of free ones out there, including Grammarly, Scribens, Ginger software, and the aptly named Hemingway app.
If You’re in Need of Dating Profile Help, We’re Coming to the Rescue!

What is VET (Vocational Education and Training)?
What is the difference between VET Education and University?
VET stands for Vocational Education and Training. VET courses are different from university degrees in that they combine practical hands-on skills with theory and are designed to prepare you for the workforce.
How long does it take to complete a VET course?
VET courses can range in duration from 6 months to 2 years, depending on the type of course you choose to study. In comparison, a standard undergraduate Bachelor degree at university is 3 years, full-time study.
When you study online with Open Colleges, you have the flexibility to work at your own pace. There are no deadlines, you just have to make sure you finish before the course expiry date. Check out your course page to find out more.
There are lots of great reasons to study a VET course. VET offers a variety of different career paths from community services to aged care, accounting to marketing, fitness to nursing, beauty therapy to construction, and more! VET courses are designed to prepare you for an ever-changing workforce, as you learn job-ready skills.
According to a recent study released by Skilling Australia Foundation, “VET’s high level of flexibility enables it to provide practical programs that teach real-life skills rather than just theory. As a result, VET graduates of the future will be able to enter the workforce with first-hand experience.
The study also found that, VET graduates have a higher employment rate than university graduates and can even earn more as a starting salary, upon graduating. Learn more here.
If you’re interested in a career that combines theory and practical work, and a rewarding career that will help you make a difference, VET is the right choice for you.
Many of the courses Open Colleges offer provide industry-recognised qualifications from accredited institutions, so you’ll be ready to start a new career, go for that promotion or re-enter the workforce as soon as you complete your course.
With the Open Colleges Career Commitment, if you don’t meet your desired outcome after 6 months of graduating from your course, we will provide an additional course or module to give you the extra skills you need to succeed.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of PAR methodology:.
As a tool to engage both administrators and teachers.
As a process of professional development through which to address issues of educational disadvantage.
The discussion will conclude by asking whether and to what extent educators in the study improved their educational practice for homeless and highly mobile students in the United States?
Context and Background Homeless (H) children may periodically live out of their parent’s car or sleep on a friend’s couch (sofa) – there are approximately 1.5 million homeless children in the United States. A recent study of homeless street youth showed that some had attended as many as 19 schools . Highly mobile (HM) or transient children attend two or more schools each school year and have been shown to be at high risk for dropping out (leaving early). There is no way to measure the size of this population.

Highly mobile (HM) or transient children attend two or more schools each school year and have been shown to be at high risk for dropping out (leaving early). There is no way to measure the size of this population.
All students are affected Because schools in the US are not on the same curricular schedule, moving from school to school is like surfing waves of educational strategy – these students frequently end up years behind their peers in literacy and comprehension (Rumberger 2003). Studies have shown that in urban areas any given cohort of students may change more than 50 % of their population every five years (Kerbow, 2003).
Studies have shown that in urban areas any given cohort of students may change more than 50 % of their population every five years (Kerbow, 2003).
50% of the US has moved in the last five years Yet educational practice has not changed to meet this challenge and pre-service preparation continues to prepare teachers as though they will be able to practise their classroom management strategies in a stable school environment.

Seventeen educators – 9 administrators Representing: 1 homeless shelter , 1 charter high school (ages 14-18) 2 middle schools (ages 11-13), 1 multi level school (grades 4 - 19) 4 elementary schools (ages 4- 10) Participants:.
1 charter high school (ages 14-18).
1 multi level school (grades 4 - 19).
4 elementary schools (ages 4- 10).
Schools that were in: rural (1) , small towns (3), suburban areas (3), urban (3).
52.9% with increasing access to educational services.
Framework for research and action that enhanced participant’s capacity to address the issues they studied.
Process of reviewing data and theory with other educators to plan action = a feeling of their own expertise.
They increased the flexibility of their educational practice (2).
What was the impact of those services?
Welcoming school culture Opened a parent welcoming centre (1) Developed a “lunch bunch” group so highly mobile or transient students could make friends and discuss their experience in school (2) Researched how students were greeted and the ways in which they learned about the school (2) Interviewed parents enrolling students mid year (3) Transmitted more information to teachers (5).

Flexible Instructional Strategies Flexible instructional strategies are something that everybody strives for all kids, you have to differentiate, it is not an easy thing to do. Teacher changed poetry in her reading curriculum to include poems about homelessness. Motivation to memorize the poems soared. At the end of the school year her homeless students had excelled in this curricula four times the expected growth.

The Southern Nevada Zoo is permanently closed but families can still visit Gilcrease Sanctuary in North Las Vegas to see a variety of animals for a small admission fee of $4 or $2 (2- 12 years of age). My only regret is that we visited the sanctuary closer to noon when it was getting hot, hot, hot!
The sanctuary has a large number of birds but I had to stop and smell....I mean smile at the baby goats. The are super cute and super stinky. Did I mention that they are cute? How can you not resist those puppy goat eyes?
There were also little horses (hey, I don't know the proper terms but they were little), emus with gigantic scary eyeballs and llamas, oh my. Unfortunately, the heat was getting to us so we cut our visit short with a promise to see the rest of the animals another day.
We (The Mister, The Kid and I) attended the RISE Lantern Festival outside of Las Vegas at the dry lake bed located in Jean, NV. It was an awesome, breathtakingly beautiful sight. However, the whole experience was marred by the lack of organization and the transportation nightmare.
The Kid was wiped out before we even got there. I somehow didn't realize that when you left the shuttle, there was a 500 yard trek through sand and rocks to the event location. Not the easiest trek for those who elected to wear wedge sandals, flip flops or heels. I felt sorry for those with babies.

The Mister was told that the CAL Ranch Store had chickens. Unfortunately, due to the summer heat, they were no longer selling them. The helpful cashier told us the chickies would be back in the fall. It's not like we were planning on buying any chickens but The Mister wants to raise them sometime in the future.
I hung out in the General Store section. Yes, this means food aisle. There was a good selection of bottled sodas and breakfast and summer sausage mixes. They had Horehound candy which I love but I still have some lurking in my desk drawer at work. I did pick up one of these burlap sacks for $1.19. I am sure I can think of something to make out of it. It seems that the store has an endless supply of them sitting in a chin-high stack on a pallet.
On the way out I stopped to check out this little display. "Grandpa says; If you get dry lips, put chicken poop on 'em so you won't lick 'em!" Yum, Free Range Chicken Poop Lip Junk for your dry lips. Seriously, what does this taste like?
No, C-A-L Ranch Las Vegas, thank you!
Dear Paper Source, What Took You So Long To Arrive In Las Vegas?
It took a trip to Houston to find out that Paper Source was opening it's doors at Tivoli Village and Town Square in Las Vegas. I was so excited I nearly peed my pants. Okay, so that's an exaggeration but I was seriously excited since I was always forced to purchase everything online. For those of you who don't know, I have a serious paper fetish. Pens too. By the way, where was I when this was advertised? Cuz, I sure could use the discount!
Yes, I would like to do something creative every day! If only I could make a living cutting and folding paper.
The Kid has inherited my passion for paper and as you can see, he had a great time at Paper Source.
I was intrigued and had to check it out. It just seemed like my kind of store and surprisingly, it was. The store is filled with novelty toys and other gadgets and gizmos that make you laugh or say "wow, that's pretty cool".
The Mister picked up a giant jumbo calculator for a friend while i opted for these $3.00 Sip-N-Spoon's that are all-in-one spoon/straws. They will be great when we make snow cones.
The Kid found these signs which can definitely come in handy...somewhere in the world.
Oh, and for all you Zombie apocalypse, end of the world types, be sure to stock up on this essential Dehydrated Water because you just never know when you will run out.
There is also a view of the Strip through a lovely yellow tinted wall of glass where all the Reese's products live. I had to snap a photo of these light fixtures before we left. How can you not love peanut butter cups hanging from the ceiling?
It was a fun-filled day at the water park but it was time to hit the road. Bye-bye Galveston.
If you haven't been, be sure to visit the Houston Arboretum and Nature Center. They have several walking trails to choose from. We took a quick route and stopped to see the wildlife and plants.
If there is one thing that I would like to bring back to Las Vegas, it's H-E-B. The grocery store of all grocery stores. They even have Central Market which carries imported goods. It reminds me of Whole Foods but better.
Lunch was so good that we hit Longhorn Steakhouse for dinner. I am pretty sure I gained 10 pounds in 2 days. But before we knew it, we were on a flight back home to LV and the 100 degree weather. I think it's much better than the Houston humidity and non-stop traffic. Not to mention toll roads. What the heck is a toll road? :).
The Farm is not that large of a place but it is packed with animals. This kitty cat didn't move the whole time we were there. Bunnies, peacocks, chickens...and something that I stepped in. Eww...I don't want to know what it is.
For a large fee, you can feed this guy. The Kid thinks he can hold up the humangous gumball machine.
Fresh local raw honey and eggs are not inexpensive but so worth it.
I love the color of these farm fresh eggs and can't wait for breakfast!
Walk, run, drive, sail, jet, promenade, bicycle, hop, skip, jump, stroll or meander to an unknown destination (mostly in the vicinity of Las Vegas).
Work, parent, live, play, eat, guzzle coffee, cook, make extra cash, clip coupons, read and deal with the summer heat on a budget.

Resolved What Tech Development From 2017 Will Have the Biggest Impact on Processes in the Year Ahead?
Looking back at the year that has almost passed, what tech development from 2017 do you think will have the biggest impact on processes in the year ahead?
It's 10:30 and no responses. Can it be that there were NO tech developments in 2017?
All of this pre-processing/post-processing stuff goes back to around 1985 to Dr Bertrand Meyer and his "Design by Contract".
"History of "Design By Contract".
A clear metaphor to guide the design process.
@Walter, can we tie your reference to pre- and post-processing to the growing problem of alarm fatigue? (I've written about this a few times too.).
Cheap data production inevitably results in human cognitive overload. "Data is cheap and business analysis is expensive". In other words especially, the post-processing. All sorts of documented anti-patterns. Or better yet, "experienced anti-patterns", as in what happens in hospitals in the ICU with nurses and alarm fatigue.
And why does the problem even arise? Because stepping up and funding the business analysis necessary to do the filters between machines that can throw millions of bits at people is hard. It's a technology meets economics meets governance problem. And it's getting worse, and probably will continue to do so before it gets better. You think?
You can get some relief from alarms by smarter rules that tighten up as you move through a process.
Example: At some step where we might, for example, be picking up a cluster of 6 data elements "name, address, city, street, zip and phone", the process designer can declare this cluster to be "mandatory" plan side, which means if one of the 6 data elements is missing, the app alarms with a notice "One or more data elements are missing".
Except that we can make that "One or more data elements are missing, do you want to record more data or skip?".
So, here, we issue an "alarm" once only, but it's a local prompt that appears whilst the user is in the form (much less intrusive compared to an alarm that rolls around every 1 minute).
Point is it could be a day, a week, or months before the next complaint/alarm relating to that data cluster.
Users can, I suppose, turn off all of their alarms ("I have had it with alarms for today!), avoiding all "missing data" notifications.
Not saying I have a "solution" to alarm fatigue but seems to me the number of alarms can be reduced significantly using various strategies.
The beauty of pre-post rules IF you can park them at process steps is that you don't have to expressly insert pre-post steps immediately upstream or downstream from a normal process step.
Unfortunately, my software (unlike Eiffel classes) cannot accommodate pre and post "edges" to steps resulting in a need for inserted "process control (i.e.gatekeeper) steps" that just sit and wait for the data they need, then fire when the data becomes available. Something for the 2018 wish list!
Now, can we get all customers to go to "smart alarms" - nope !
My point was not about being faster (how did this even get across, I don't know), but about reusability of common complex process patterns. That's why I only bolded the word "reused".
You didn't (suggest "faster"). However, "reading between the lines", I thought your tech and associated use cases created an opening for faster roundtrips, which can have a huge impact on learning. So I guess that means business case. (Sorry previous note done from a phone included an "?" which kind of changed the meaning. . . .).
But reuseability in itself is a business model capability for a cloud platform, which may be a different than simply faster deployments. It's about clarity of business process vision and inclusiveness of the underlying architecture.
I think the "marriage" between BPM and modern digital archives (i.e. blockchain-based storage) will allow BPM expanding beyond organisational boundaries. Thus BPM can coordinate people, organisations, services, etc. in the end-to-end (from the customer's point-of-view) manner.
Karl, also we need "ordinary" people as trading partners but those people can't afford to run platforms. Thus it is necessary to have an independent trusted platform. Example - http://improving-bpm-systems.blogspot.ch/2016/07/digital-contract-as-process-enables.html.
I need to get to understand blockchain. I have the book I recall you recommended. All fascinating!
Alexander - I think there are some newer BPM platforms (can we call them "platforms"?) which ARE affordable for SMB and are INTENDED to be affordable to SMB -- at least in terms of technology access. Then it's up to sales to get the customer (notice "customer", not "client") to budget the time for business analysis (whether or not one actually uses a professional business analyst or not).
We still do a lot of our platform programming in pure O-O.
Instead of having eight teams for eight products, we have one team for eight products.. . . Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism almost allow you to make a new product any day you like. The big chore is the terminology which has to change when you go from one industry/app to another - nothing to do with programming.
@David, you have shared bits and pieces of your story with the BPM.com community over time,, and it's fascinating. And now your note today especially resonated with me because I spent 6 years in the Magic Software ecosystem (late 90's early 00's).
Magic at that time was one of the big four RAD tools (along with PowerBuilder, Delphi and Progress -- and hundreds of other lesser knowns). Magic's claim to fame was that it was entirely rules-driven (with strongly defined pre- and post-processing too). I note the rules were lower level than what you would define as a full-on business rule today, but entire applications could be constructed declaratively. Magic (still traded on NASDAQ) had some amazing successes world-wide, especially, like Progress, through channels (one notable success being almost 20 large life and annuity insurance providers in North America). An experienced Magic programmer was typically an order of magnitude more productive than any competitor code-based technology.
Why mention all this? Because I've wondered and analyzed over the years why "the better mousetrap" was not more successful. Sure, part of the reason was that most organizations realized they should not be in the custom software business, and in the early 90's big and small ERP systems rolled down from Mount Olympus and were adopted by smaller and smaller enterprises. The RAD tools market collapsed.
I guess stupid customers are at fault for allowing vendors to be in the driver's seat.
Surely, with phishing, fake invoices, customers are becoming more knowledgeable/wary, so why can't they just verify for themselves during a WebEx or GoToMeting what a platform looks like and how it runs, particularly in the area of visual mapping, compile and run-time testing of a small yet representative workflow?
If it takes more than 1 hour, they should probably move on.
Not an easy question to be answered, since I don't recall a specific breakthrough research in 2017 that in fact can cause a tangible change to the 2018's BPM market. Landing at https://www.technologyreview.com/lists/technologies/2017/, I would say bots, IoT (payments) and self-driving vehicles stand out as likely candidates of having an impact on business processes to come. However, I think their effect on BPM and BPMS in particular, will be a more gradual thing.
Payments are of course a superset of invoicing. (The point of the animation was to show business people that what they were buying actually made sense.) BPM will win if it can be shown that the technology is easier than coding with frameworks (and that performance will be good too). Given the risks at stake BPM is a much better solution -- because you're working directly with payment processes "as first-class citizens" of the system.
Thanks for sharing. I recognize the general layout from several countries' now adopted e-invoicing standards. For some strange reason, in most cases, most governments have completely ignored the BPM component as part of the greater payment life cycle,sadly leaving the standardized XML files to be orchestrated manually.
Glad you took the time to see the animation Kay! Now I will share some results (see URL below).

It will be very confusing to the public to have so many different names for 4 iPhone's.
Apple typically uses the same form factor for 2 years for cost savings. This allows it to reap incredible economies of scale compared to throwing out their design and R&D work and manufacturing setup after just 1 year. This strategy has worked pretty well so far and I don't see Apple abandoning it anytime soon.
It could change next year. My theory is that Apple might offer a plastic version of the iPhone 6 (but no 6+), reserving the larger iPhone for the 6s+ (or whatever it's called).
All the more reason why they should skip the S model and go straight to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ IMO.
That makes absolutely no sense. We had the 4 and 4S, as well as the 3G and 3GS, in the same year and nobody got confused.

No such thing in pro sports. So yeah it's semantics, but it's important to differentiate between winner speak and loser speak.........and any coach or player would bristle at the term "moral victory.".
You're forgetting the voices in my head, there's at least 12-24 of those going depending on time of day.
If we go 1-5 the next six games, no one's looking back on this game as a good loss, almost win or whatever backhanded superlative floats your boat.
That's just crazy talk. This Morale boost will keep me going for 4 or 5 losses at least.
Damn, I must have missed that episode!
What's NOT to be optimistic about? If we can continue with this Ground Chuck mindset, I could care less about W-L this season. Of course I want the Hawks to make the playoffs and win the Superb Owl. But if that doesn't happen, then I'll settle for second best---that we have a dominating run game again. RB yac floats my boat!
Like I just watched on Good Morning Football, they said...
You're damn right. Even my girlfriend Kay Adams said something to the effect of how I feel which is why do I feel so good about Seattle after a loss?
Because you can see the beginning of what is to come. It's 2012 all over again.
Saying the Rams and Chiefs are built to win in September and not the playoffs seems like rationalisation or hopefulness to me. They're the best teams in the league until proven otherwise. I wouldn't be surprised if one of them fell off though, it's certainly not a foreign scenario for the Chiefs.
5 games in, and the draft picks are a swing and a miss? People keep making comments like this and exposing themselves, I love it.
adeltaY wrote: It comes across like you're saying starting off hot is not a good thing, which its baffling. Just because the Seahawks and Patriots have got off to slow starts and finished well doesn't mean it's a good thing. In fact, the 2013 Seahawks team was something like 11-1 and didn't finish hot and they won it all.
Sigh. I didn't say we were an 11-5 team, only that the feeling is exactly the same. Hawks lose, and the world crashes down for many here. When this team loses, even in 13-15, people would complain that we didn't have what it takes, the philosophy is all wrong, etc.
And the opposite side of the spectrum is just as sick after a win, the delusions and run the table posts never get old at all.
But I definitely was surprised to see the game so close, but in division games, they historically are. Regardless of records. The crux of it is do you believe pete can bring this team back, or do you think he’s done. Well fought and I was impressed in the loss. But it all boils down to coaching and decision making for me , whether it’s betting on a unproven kicker/ punter AGAIN. And management on that last drive AGAIN.

among which preachers I include, as by far the most powerful, the.
members of the fourth estate. In the nineteenth century, War should be.
simply impossible. That it is possible is a proof of the failure of.
the Christian religion, so far, to enfranchise the world.
I have cast "The Shadow of the Sword" as a crumb upon the waters. It.
been accepted, and praised without stint, by many, as an attack on.
Despotism in the person of the first Napoleon. I trust, however, that.
it is something more--an attack on War in the abstract, as the.

That was a bitter blow for the mother, and for a space her heart was.

"Let us go!" said Marcelle in a low voice.
She was superstitious, and the allusion to the old legend made her.

of a great monster. Do you remember the story of the great Sea-beast.

and the whole side of the Gate, blackly silhouetted against the green.

"If you could stop here and watch, you would say so truly. In a little.
foam, and the air is filled with a roar like the bellowing of a beast.
I have sat here and watched till I thought the old story was come true.
and the monster was there; but that was in time of storm.".
"You watched it--up in the Trou?".
then the storm went down, but the tide was high. The water washed.
close to the roof of the Gate, and when the wave rose there was not.
Well, I was hungry, and knew not what to do. It was pleasant to see.
it washing over the rocks and stones where we sat to-day, and to see.
the seals swimming round and round and trying in vain to find a spot.
to rest on. But all that would not fill one's stomach. I waited, and.
then it grew dark, but the tide was still high. It was terrible then,.
for the stars were clustered up yonder, and the shapes of the old.
I left my hat and sabots at the mouth of the cave, and slipped down.
from ledge to ledge, and dropped down into the water--it was dark as.

there was a glimmer, and I could just see the top of the arch. So I.
came close, treading on the sea, till I could almost touch the arch.
have been lifted up and crushed against the jagged stones of the arch;.
but I held my breath and struck forward--eight, nine, ten strokes.
"I was floating on the great wave just outside the arch, with the sea.
before me and the stars above my head. Then I thought all safe, but.
had to do then was to swim on for a hundred yards, and turn in and.
"Let us go, now," she cried, "or the sea will come again, and this.
"What then? The water is warm.".
At every step it grew deeper, and soon the maiden had to resign his.
they were pretty, of course, and she felt no shame. True modesty does.
They had reached the portal and were only knee-deep, but before them.
"Have no fear," he replied, coming close to her. "Hold your apron!".
the book he had been reading, he lifted her like a feather in his.
"You are heavier than you used to be," he said, laughing; while.
his neck with the other. Slowly and surely, step by step, he waded.
he went deeper, and when he reached the end of the wall the water had.
the shore, so that he was soon only knee-deep again. His heart was.
the water, unwilling to resign the treasure he held within his arms.
It was then that he turned his face up to hers for the first time; and.
And why? It was only this--in the excitement and struggle of the.
hallowed as an Eastern woman's face, and is only to be seen by the.
his eyes, and the scent of it--who knows not the divine perfume even.
He stood now on dry land, but he still held her in his arms. The sweet.

in all the nudity of passion. They had passed in an instant from the.
cold clear air to the very heart of Love's fire, and there they moved,.
and turned to golden shapes, and lived.
Then, they passed out again, and through the flame, into the common.
All this time he held her in his arms, and would not let her go. Her.
"I love you, Marcelle!--and you?".
There was only a moment's pause, during which her eyes trembled on his.
she closed her eyes, and in answer to him, then and for ever, let her.
kiss, and all the life-blood of each heart flowed through that warm.
By this time, however, she had recovered herself; so she gently.

all the contents of her lap. Then she sat down with her back to Rohan,.
and drew on her stockings, and could he have marked her face just.
turned to him she was quite pale and cool--and the sweet hair was hid.
still trembling from head to foot.
"Marcelle! you love me? ah, but you give me good news--it is almost.
He took both her hands in his, and drew her forward to him, but this.
"Did you not know?" she said softly.
"I cannot tell; yes, I think so; but now it seems so new. I was afraid.
because I was your cousin you might not love me like that. I have.
known you all these years, and yet it now seems most strange.".
"But you love me, Marcelle?" he cried again.
"No, not as to-day;" and she blushed again.
"It is the men that change, not we women.".
"And you will marry me, Marcelle?".
"That is as the good God wills.".
"We shall have his blessing too.".
"And my brothers also, and my Uncle the Corporal.".
After that there was a brief silence. To be candid, Rohan was not.
quite sure of his uncle, who was a man of strange ideas, differing.
them he would try, being a man of strong measures, to enforce them.
Still, the thought of him was only a passing cloud, and Rohan's face.
It was a clear bright day, and every nook and cranny of the great.
covered as far as the eye could see with a dim heat, like breath on a.
heart of the cliff, wound and wound until it reached the summit; it.
was partly natural, partly hewn by human hands: here and there it was.
It was a hard pull to the summit, and for a great part of the way.

"How should they if we are wise? We are cousins, and we shall meet no.
"And when one meets, one need not show one's heart to all the world.".
"That is true also. And my mother shall not know.".
"Why should she? She will know all in good time. We are doing no.
wrong, and a secret may be kept from one's people without sin.".
"All the village would talk if they knew, and your mother perhaps most.
of all. A girl does not like her name carried about like that, unless.
"Perhaps--yes, I think so--but nevertheless who can tell?".
"Then nothing but the good God can keep us asunder, and He is just!".

"Who was she?" asked Marcelle. "The name is not of our parish.".
took her knowledge from the lips of the priest, and from the pictures.
districts the least known of all books is the Bible.
"She was flying away from a city of wicked people, and God told her.
not to look back; but women are curious, above all, and she broke.
God's bidding, and for that He turned her into a stone like this, only.
it was made of salt. That is the story, Marcelle!".
"She was a wicked woman, but the punishment was hard.".
"I think sometimes myself that this must once have been alive. Look,.
Marcelle! Is it not like a monster with a white beard?".
"The good God forbid," she said.
"Have you not heard my mother tell of the great stones on the plain,.
and how they are petrified ghosts of men; and how, on the night of.
No�l, they turn into life again, and bathe in the river and quench.
"Is it foolish, too, that the stone faces on the church walls are the.
devils that tried to burst in when the place was built and the first.
mass was said, but that the saints of God stopped them and turned them.
"Master Arfoll is a strange man. Some say he does not believe in God.".
"Do not listen to them. He is good.".
"Did he say that?" asked Rohan in a low voice.
"He did--I heard him--ah, God, the great good Emperor, that any one.
alive should speak of him like that! If my uncle had heard him there.
would have been blood. It was dreadful! It made my heart go cold.".
Rohan did not answer directly. He knew that he was on delicate ground.
When he did speak, he kept his eyes fixed nervously upon the grass.
"That the Emperor has gone too far, that it would be better for France.
"More than that; better that he had never been born.".
"And you too believe this?" she cried, in a low shuddering whisper,.
"He is a devil!" cried the girl, with a fierceness which showed the.

"Because then I should hate you, as I hate all the enemies of God. I.
hate all the enemies of the great Emperor.".

God, it is too terrible! Even here, in what men call God's own book"--.
and he held up the old Bible--"it is the same red story, the same mad.

Rohan trembled, for he knew what that meant.

broken Calvary, like a sign of misery and desolation.
He was about to speak, when the church gate swung open, and forth from.
from which he ever and anon drew his pipe to emit a cloud of smoke,.
As he came out of the churchyard, he might have been taken for some.
His life was hard, and had been a perilous one. He rose with the lark,.
although (to be quite honest) he not unfrequently went to bed with it!
He lived in a dismal hut, where an Englishman would scarcely keep his.
cow; he was liable to be called out at any hour and in any weather to.

the Revolution and the Civil War. He was a man of no "ideas," and he.
performed his priestly functions--such as marrying and giving in.

To sum up, his intellectual grasp was small, but his scholastic.

He demanded his rights on principle, and then when they were paid,.
whether in the shape of money or grain, he rattled them in his pocket.
then, perhaps the very next day, he turned them into bread or wine or.
brandy, and shared them among the sick and hungry at his door.
The itinerant shook his head sadly.
"News, father," he exclaimed. "Ah, there is none--only, of course, the.
the lands around. I do not think that it can last long--the patience.
so much of terror and death that he had no particular horror for them,.

than the Blue, but he would never have instigated any man to die for.
the White. The respectable sort of thing, he believed, was to die,.

element in human nature, and he was not politician enough to blame any.
Master Arfoll continued, in a low voice--"I will tell you something, a.
small thing, but a sign of the end. I was stopping in a village far.
away east, and I entered the house of a woman who had lost both her.
sons in the last campaign, and but a week before buried her husband.".
"She was sitting on a form, staring into the fire, and her eyes seemed.
fixed and mad. I touched her on the shoulder, and she did not stir; I.
before me food and drink. Then she sat down again before the fire, and.
I saw that her hair was white, though she was not old. When I had.
eaten and drunken--for I was very hungry--I spoke to her again, and.
this time she listened, and I told her I was a schoolmaster and was.
her children to write and read. She laughed, father--ah, it was a.
terrible laugh. 'Go then and seek them,' she cried, pointing to the.
door, 'and when you have found them in their graves among the snow,.
come back and teach me to curse the hand that killed them and buried.
drag him down! Teach me how to kill him, and curse him down into hell-.

and spat it out. My heart was sick. I could not help her, and I crept.

"That is but one house out of thousands upon thousands. The curses go.

"I care not," cried the schoolmaster. "The Emperor may be a great.

Her mother, a simple peasant woman, still retained in her heart all.

miracles of all the saints. She had escaped the worship of her class.
She had been a fruitful woman. Her husband, the Corporal's elder.
brother, was a fisherman, who had perished in the great gale of 1796,.
and the Corporal, then a private soldier coming home on leave from.
Italy, had found her a widow with a large circle of helpless.
Then and there, with his brother's children clinging round neck and.
had sworn a great oath that he would never marry, but be a father to.
the fatherless, a brother to his brother's wife. And he had kept his.
strength of idolatry, he had carefully avoided all temptation to waste.
his hard-earned rewards; he had sometimes, indeed, been deemed a mean.
and a hard man in consequence; but the little family had never wanted,.

Strange to say, these stories sank deepest into the heart of the.

"What does the boy mean?" inquired the widow.
"Fetch thy heart's delight and let him try," he cried. "Mother, ask.
"Wast thou there to-day, my child?".
There was no hesitation in the reply.
"It is a long way to walk. What took thee so far, my child?".
"I went down the Ladder of St. Triffine on to the shore to look for.

but what we saw was this: a man like a fisherman wading up to his.

he carried her round from the Gate, and sat her down upon the shore.

Then, thoroughly pleased with herself, she smiled; and the image.

was a figure of Our Lady, with the Infant in her lap holding a lily.
Presently, in a low clear voice, she prayed for those who loved her.
and whom she loved. For the soul of her dead father, for the old.
moment. Then uncovering her eyes, she looked up, not at the picture of.
Our Lady and her Son, but at another picture, less large and highly.
coloured, which hung on the same wall.
It was that of a Man in soldier's costume, standing on an eminence and.

She was not a popular member of that assembly, for she had two great.
drawbacks in the eyes of the women--her beauty, and her connection.
As a rule, the Fountain (the place of many pools was always spoken of.
thus, in the singular number) was a scene of extraordinary animation.
As for the younger females, they clustered together, and discussed.

she had a mighty man's heart, which would break rather than find.
"No one says it is not true," said the girl called Joan, a small but.
adult girl who walked lame, "but the time is not fixed, and some say.

the Emperor does not take the only sons.".
"It is a good thing," she cried, with a scornful laugh, "to have three.

"Will you not come in?" she said, setting down her pitcher.
The street was empty, and they were quite alone.
He had both her hands now, and was drawing her face quietly to his.
All at once she drew back, laughing, and said--.
"After all, then, the news is true!".
"What news?" he asked, kissing her.
"There will be more war. The Emperor is mad against the Germans.".
It was as if the lips of a corpse had been put to his; he drew back.
"What is the matter?" she asked softly.
"It is nothing; only the night is cold. And so there will be more war?
Well, that is old news at the best.".

"We beseech thee to hear us, O Lord!".
He brooded in the midst of his city, and his eyes surveyed the silent.
earth. As a spider in the heart of its web, he lay and waited in the.

Courage of a certain sort he did not lack; that we have shown already.

fact is not to be denied, the mere dread of being drawn for the.
enormous strength, and make him tremble to the very soul.

And the more that Rohan's thoughts grew, the more food they received.
As in a glass darkly, he got bloody glimpses of the history of.
leaders to misery and death, and he thanked the good God who made him.
he became conscious that Humanity, in the failure of the French.
Revolution, had lost the mightiest of its chances; that instead of the.
world. With his own eyes, year by year, he had seen the Angel of the.
for a sign; with his own ears, year after year, he had heard the.
rejoicing in his strength and freedom, for the martyrs of the.

The freedom of the waters was with him, and he breathed now securely.

numberless creatures of the ocean he seemed to see the passing of.
and the horror of the Deep troubled him, and he threw up his face to.

his fellows. It did not even occur to him that his escape would be.
he knew his fate he would be prepared, but he could not know it yet.
He had been accustomed to go for long days without food, and this day.
he neither ate nor drank. All his hunger and thirst were in his eyes,.
against it, towards the shore; and now the sun had declined so far.
that the purple shadow of the boat ran beside him on the sea, and.
stood up in the boat and gazed eagerly up the hill, where the sunlight.
not another boat was upon the water but his own. The whole village.

heard the murmur of many voices.

"It is all over, as they say. God has been good to me and my mother,.
There was a general murmur of condolence from the old women, and a.
adding, while the men shrank back before him, "It is false! you are.
doing this to make a jest of me! How can I be drawn? I was not there!".

a wink at the conscripts--"Oh yes, that is all very well, but the.

A hard struggle had gone on in the heart of the girl. When first she.

she forgot her self-reproach, and determined to act an heroic part in.
all the scenes which were to follow.
and she did not calculate for any extraordinary resistance on the part.

"Keep back! Do not touch me!" he cried with outstretched arm.
"The boy is mad!" cried the Corporal.
it is so? I had it from thine own lips, and I drew in thy name, and.
convulsively; his eyes were still fixed upon the ground. In a moment.
Another cheer rose, and the Corporal nodded, as much as to say, "That.
"And now--forward!" cried the Corporal. "We will drink his health.".
There was a movement towards the door, but suddenly Rohan started as.
if from a trance, and cried--"Stay!".
"You are all mad, I think, and I seem going mad too. What is this you.
tell me about a Conscription and an Emperor? I do not understand. I.
only know you are mad, and that my uncle there is maddest of all. You.
say that my name is drawn, and that I must go to be killed or to kill?
I tell you only God can draw my name, and I will not stir one foot,--.
the Corporal, he cried; "Your Emperor can kill me, but he cannot.
compel me to be a soldier. Before God. I deny his right to summon me.
to fight for him, for he is a Devil. If every man of France had my.
heart, he would not reign another day, for he would have no army, no.
"It seems to me that there is only one word for my cousin Rohan. He is.

the boy is not well, is under a charm--we will try to think so, my.
braves. He may come to-morrow and ask forgiveness of the good Emperor,.
and pray to be allowed to join you others who fight for your country.
If not, mark you, we will come to fetch him; he shall not disgrace us.
without a cause. He thinks he is very strong, but that is a man's.
strength against ours, against the Emperor's? I tell you we will hunt.
him down if need be--like a fox, like a dog; and look you, I his uncle.
without his will he will join you, remember that; and if he goes.
did not mean all he said; he spoke in passion, and then men do not.
utter their right minds. And he is no coward, but a brave man--yes,.
At this there was a general groan.
"I will not be silent, for it is my fault, and it is I that have.
it might not be so, but God has willed it--God and His saints, who.
will watch over you when you go to war!".
Rohan looked sadly into the girl's face, and when he saw the wet eyes,.
the quivering lips, his heart was stirred. He took her hand and kissed.
An ill-favoured face was suddenly thrust forward between them.
"It is a pity, is it not," cried Mikel Grallon, "to see a pretty girl.
fell like a log. A wild cry arose from all the men, the women.
"Arrest him!" cried the corporal.

Rohan shook his head, and continued to stand.
"I have been drawn for the Conscription. My own hand did not draw the.

amazed, as if you did not understand. Well, understand this--I will.

spoken like this man. They had come in tears and gone in tears,.
"You are drawn?--I am sorry for you, my poor fellow, but you will have.

this time. It is hard, but the Emperor must have men.".
the latter's great discomfort. At last he spoke.
will not spare me, my countrymen will not help me. So I have come to.
and to you that war is abominable, that the Emperor is a devil, that.
France is a shambles. I will keep your God's commandment--that is, I.
will do no murder; I will not obey the Emperor--that is, I refuse to.
do wickedness because I am tempted by the Devil. Your God is a God of.
now! It is for His help that I have come.".
It was difficult to tell whether the speaker's manner was quite.
"My son, you should be on your knees when you come asking help from.
prayer, He grants much--perhaps all. It seems to me you are angry. It.
Rohan answered at once, in the same tone.
"I know that; I have heard it before. Well, I have prayed often, but.
who are a good man, with a heart for the poor--is it right that these.
wars should take place? is it right that five hundred thousand men.
should have perished as they did with last year's snow? is it right.
that the Emperor should now call for nearly four hundred thousand.
other, to wade in each other's blood to the ankles? If all this is.
right, then, mark you, Christ is wrong, and there is no place left in.
Then, standing before the fire and putting on a severe look, he.
"You do not understand these things. I do not say that you have no.
cause for complaint, but as to what you say, there has always been.
war, and it is in the Book of God. Men are quarrelsome, look you; so.
are nations; and a nation or a man, it is all one. If a man struck.
thee on one cheek, hold up to him the other'?".
"That is the letter, mon garz, but we must look to the spirit. Ah yes,.
the spirit is the thing! Now, we are alone, and I will tell you.
honestly I do not love the Emperor; he has been rough with the Holy.
Father, and he is not a King by Divine Right; but there he is, and we.
must obey, all of us--the Church as well as you others. I will give.
to look at it. Your soul belongs to God, and He will watch over it;.
but as for your perishable body, it belongs in the meantime to--.
humph!--well, to C�sar--in other words, to the Emperor!".
"To whom?" he asked in a hollow voice.
The priest crossed himself and approached the prie-dieu.
"How is that, my son? Come, prayer will soothe your troubled spirit,.
and let you hear the still voice of God.".
"No, I cannot pray; least of all to Him.".
"Do not be angry, Father Rolland; I am not to be won by fear. You are.
a good man, but your God is not for this world, and it is this world.
"Father, I love my life, and my strength, and the woman that is in my.
heart, and my mother--all these I love; and peace. You call my body.

and no boats of any size were putting to sea. For all that, he was un.

his name out of the lists, and grant me now thy grace, that I may.
Then she looked up, as was her nightly custom, at the picture of the.
Mother and all the Saints, preserve the good Emperor, for whom my poor.
over his enemies, and bring him back to us safe, as thou bringest.
She rose and walked across the room to the window. The moon was.
shining bright, for it was at the full.
she saw the figure of a man, leaning and looking up at her window.
She crept close to the window and opened it. The moon shone on her.
He had answered that call, but this time he did not come. He looked up.
On a bright sunny day, about a week after the drawing of lots in the.
away, a strange group. In the centre sat an elderly man, with a book.
him, some looking over his shoulders, others seated on the ground--a.
five and twenty, who wore a broad beaver hat and an old-fashioned.
sat with his mouth and eyes wide open, a model of stupidity and.
Arfoll's shoulders, a little boy and a little girl of six--the most.
peasant--in a black suit, tiny sabots, and a broad-brimmed hat; the.
little old man and woman, the girl with her hands folded primly on her.
bosom, the boy with his little hands stuck firmly in the waistband of.
Inland, scattered here and there, sometimes surrounded by fir trees,.
of pasture, and stretching along the low granite cliffs of the sea.
he sat, could trace the sea-coast for many miles away--the blue capes.
cast its dark shadow on the grass.
The girl came closer, put her little face close into the book, and.
time, fared no better than before.
Presently, when the adult peasant came up to try, it was worst of all.
great delight in the pursuit of knowledge, and when the other pupils,.
grinned and scratched his head with the utmost good-humour.
It was a scene for a painter. The sun shone brightly on the happy.
rising ever higher and higher, a lark was singing.
All listened eagerly; it was a story, like one of the tales told at.
"Pour forth, I beseech thee, O Lord, Thy grace into the hearts of.
these Thy children; that they, when the time comes, may know Thee and.
even as brute beasts of the field. Enlighten them, since they need.
light. Amen! Teach them, since they are willing to be taught. Amen!
of love and peace, and may they meet at Thy great Supper, when the.
days of their life are done. Amen, Amen!".
"That is enough for to-day," he said, with his hand on little Katel's.
head. "To-morrow we will meet here, my children, at the same hour.".
"Tell thy mother I will stay with her to-night.".
"Nay, that is not fair," cried out one of the older girls. "You.
this way and that, the two young boys running with shouts and cries.
teachers, educated by the Church, who travelled from village to.
conditions. Sometimes in the fields, in the intervals of labour;.
liked to stay, and had a certain honour among the ignorant people; for.
an odour of sanctity hung about them, seeing that they had been reared.
in the bosom of the Church. They passed thus from village to village,.
till they were too weak to travel any longer afoot; then some of them,.
were scattered as sparks, and most of them disappeared for ever.
During the later years of the Empire, when it was most the cue of.
At the time of the Revolution, Master Arfoll must have been about.
seeing his face before about the beginning of the new century. His.
reported that he had been a dweller in one of the great cities, and.
that there, during the years of Terror, he had known such experiences.
However that may be, the people knew him and loved him. A good man,.
called hard in a certain sense, but it was nevertheless the life of.
towards the sea. He had been "sowing his seed," and he felt happy. A.
hand, and with both hands behind his back, he moved past the moss-.
He was passing by, when suddenly he heard a sound behind his back; at.
the same moment, a hand was placed upon his shoulder. He turned.
quickly, and there, as if sprung from the very bowels of the earth,.
It does not take many hours, of hunting to turn a human being into an.
man I thought you would never have done.".
"It has come as I feared--that is all.".
"And I am drawn!" answered Rohan. "Ten days ago was the drawing, and.
the day before yesterday was the medical inspection. A week since old.
Unfortunately, I was not at home, and could not entertain them.".
clear to the schoolmaster, and infinite pity filled his heart.
since we parted, and it has come to this. It is a sad fatality, my.
Rohan turned his face away, to hide the mist that clouded his eyes.
"I knew that it was coming, and it came, though I did not attend the.
came to arrest me. My own friends were worst, for they could not bear.
that they should go and I should escape. Four days ago they hunted me.
from home. I laughed at them, for I knew the ways a thousand times.
better than they. Well, I was in despair: I thought of thee. I have.
sabots and to run; but a soldier caught me by the sleeve, as you see.
"I questioned at night, when they could not recognise me, and I found.
you might accompany them up to the farms. Then I sprang out, as you.
and the purple shadows of the capes stretched out far away.
"Speak, then! what am I to do?".
Master Arfoll started, for he had been plunged in deep thought.
"My son, it is terrible!--I am stupefied---I cannot advise you, for I.
are precious now, and they will rejoice over thee. Otherwise I see no.
way; for if they find thee afterwards, it is death.".
"I know that; but in any case I can die, and they shall not take me.
alive against my will. But say, is this your advice, that I should.
"That I should become a soldier of the Emperor?".
it will be thy fault if it takes any creature's life; and then, thou.
"No more. I know no other hope, my son.".
"Can I not escape?--out of France?--to another country?".
"If I could reach Morlaix, where there are ships!".
for thou art a man in a hundred. Thou hast felt it already. They would.
discover thee, and then,--no mercy!".
"To yield myself up! To become a soldier of the Emperor! Well, that is.
not fair; for I am a man. When a man swears an oath before God it is.
that man's place to keep it or die. My father, do you remember that.
night when we watched the women at the Fountain, and when I asked you.
instructing for the best. But now he was reminded, as in many a.
common creature, but one made in the most unique mould of nature.
for it bade me break my oath. I said I would never become a soldier;.
creature's death; that I might be killed, but that I would never kill.
The time has come, and I am to be proved. You say there is no escape;.
but, as I said before, I can die.".
trembled at them, though there were no tears on his own. They walked.
slowly on, till they came to the edge of the cliffs, and saw beneath.
remark to another, "There will be wind to-night, and rain. Look at.
that bank of clouds creeping up in the south-west.".
him, placing one hand on his shoulder.
"I am angry with myself. To be so weak! to feel so helpless! to know.
such things are done, and yet be unable to lift a hand! My son, I.
deserved your rebuke, for you are right and I was wrong. It is wrong.
to acquiesce in evil, even to save one's life; it is accursed to draw.
I say in my heart, 'God bless him! he is right!--he is a brave man,.
and were I indeed his father I should be proud of such a son.".
Stretching out his hands, he cried--.
"My father, you have spoken at last, and it was for those words I.
face a look which, if seen in a poet or a musician, would be called.
"I came for those words! All are against me, save my mother and thou!
all are against me, even the one I love best in the world. A good.
art my good father, and to go to war is dishonour, though they think.
me now thy blessing, and let me go!".
"My blessing! Rohan, it is not worth giving! You would say so, if you.
thou wast once a Priest. Your words, your love, have made me what I.
am, and your blessing will make me better and stronger still. You have.
justified. Now bless me, and leave all the rest to God.".
He bowed his head; and then and there, touching his hair with gentle.
weather was coming, and that afternoon it came.
blossomed furze grew a tall man's height, and more than once, to find.
a path, he had to crawl down and creep like a fly along the very face.
of the crag, which was touched here and there by the sun to rosy.
look had vanished, to be replaced by a sad self-possession; for as the.
path, he felt the companionship of Nature, the happiness and freedom.
to madness, for he was a man against the World.
He was in revolt against his fellows. He had refused to follow the.
Instead of being bound like a slave in a soldier's livery and carrying.

feel it as he threw himself down on the soft green grass. The living.
strength grew. It was something, after all, to be a man. It was more.
to be admitted to the sacrament of Nature, partaken of by all those.
The last touch of this sacrament came from a good Man's blessing.
Before that was given he had been weak and afraid; now he came back to.
superior to his fellows; since, let us admit it at once, he combined.
These were the thoughts and feelings that kept his heart up for many a.
Presently he drew from his breast a piece of black bread, and began to.
All this was nothing new. Hundreds of times he had done for sheer.
all matured, and he turned his steps eastward, to his native village.
habitation was to be seen, not a sign of humanity in any form. Herds.
of wild cattle crouched together in the rain, and on the edges of the.
to life and stirring in answer to the Spirit of the Storm.
on the great plain before, and he knew by the situation of many of the.
A flash of crimson light arose from the very edge of the ocean,.
Suddenly, instead of turning away, he ran forward in the direction of.
still, and gazed in horror once again.
Close to the edge of the cliffs--held down by ropes attached to.
seven or eight men and two or three old women. Some, running round and.
them from the torrents of rain; and crawling up close in the shadow of.
severe laws passed after the Revolution had never been able to.
were about, but he was also cognizant of his own danger and wished to.
act with caution. His resolution was soon taken, and he acted upon it.
"Don't cry so loud, mother," cried a man. "'Tis enough to waken the.
A bottle was passed across to the woman, and she raised it to her.
the night. All, men and women alike, leaped panic-stricken to their.
On the very top of the stone stood a gigantic figure waving its arms,.
terrible, and the boldest man there was panic-stricken.
Springing down upon the cage, he seized it with all his strength,.
loosened it from its ropes and stones, and cast it over into the.
blinded by the light, could at first distinguish nothing; and.
overwhelmed by the fury of wind and rain, he cast himself upon the.
The drawing was over, the medical inspection had taken place, and the.
Now, it so happened that the wish of his heart was granted, and Ho�l.
those who had drawn lower numbers turned out unfit for service, not to.
their tickets, and have to march.
aiding them as far as lay in their power. All in vain. After the first.
"Ah, Sergeant Pipriac! I never thought you could be so cruel to his.
The Sergeant, a little one-eyed, hook-nosed martinet, very fond of the.
He had been a great friend of her husband, and his present conduct.
"Malediction! one must do one's duty. Mother, thy son is a fool; and.
were I not after him, there would be others far worse to do the job!

And while one of the gendarmes pushed his head up the chimney, and.

"Bah! that is not so easy, and he knows better than to trust himself.
in a land of wild beasts. No, he is here. I know it--I smell it as a.
"He will not fight. He creeps away and hides. He is afraid.".
"It is not that. My Rohan is afraid of nothing, but he will never.
The old fellow snapped his fingers.
"Good day, mother! but, mind you, we shall come again; it is not our.
fault, but the Emperor's orders. Take my advice, and persuade him; in.
another day it will be too late. Now, then--march!".
and being a very quiet, retiring woman, given to her own thoughts, she.
had seen very little of her sister or her children. People thought her.
whereabouts, she only spoke the truth. She had not seen her son for.
several days, and she was almost hoping that he had made good his.
the country was covered with snares and traps for deserters, and how.
difficult it was to elude the vigilant eyes of the public officials.
caught, he would be shot like a dog.

God. And the Emperor was like God--so great, so very far away!
She sat listening to the wind, which was rising that afternoon, and to.
the rain, which was beating against the door. Crouched near to her,.
the she-goat, her son's favourite, and now her only companion.
a halo round his head, came walking to them on the sea.

off a large black cloak which was wet with rain.
They had only met once since that scene on the night of the drawing,.
who it was, she grew pale, and her heart began to palpitate, as, with.
no greeting, she turned her eyes again upon the fire.
There was no answer. The widow still felt her heart full of anger.
"I could not bear to think of thee sitting here all alone, and though.
my uncle did not wish it, I have come over. Ah, God, thou art lonely!
It is dreadful when all the world is against one's own son.".
The widow stirred in her chair, and said, still looking at the fire--.
"It is yet more dreadful when one's own blood relations hate us most.
marry, you will know what it is to suffer like me, and you will pity.
but said nothing. Marcelle, too, fixed her eyes upon the fire, and.
leant forward, warming her hands as she continued to speak.
It was a curious sight to see those two women--one so old and grey,.
the other so fresh and pretty--sitting on one form side by side, not.
looking in each other's face, but both, whether speaking or listening,.
There was a long silence, and the wind and the sea cried still louder.
outside. Finally the widow said, in the same low voice--.
"Why have you come, child? What has brought you here at last?".
The answer was a short, hard, bitter laugh.
"So! Well, he is safe, if you desire to know. You may go back to those.
who sent you, and tell them that much from me. Yes!" she continued,.
her voice rapidly rising in anger, "I know well what you come for,.
Marcelle was a high-spirited girl, and it is doubtful if she would.
have borne as much from any other woman in the world. Strange to say,.
she was now quite gentle, and only put her hand on her aunt's arm,.
"Don't! don't speak like that, for the love of God!".
Marcelle was not given to the melting mood.
"Marcelle, what do you mean? Why do you cry?".
The tone was sharp, but the look of the speaker's face was kinder.
"Never mind! You think I have no heart! Well, I will go, for you do.
not trust me, and I have no right to vex you. But if you knew! if you.
But the widow, from the new light on her niece's cheeks, was beginning.

me,--for he has asked me to be his wife!".
so much in itself, for she had often had her suspicions, but it was.
ever; for the widow was in her own mind going over the past, and.

"It is strange, as you say!" she cried. "Ah! it was terrible to me,.

had appeared for him, the black mark would have been put at once.
and he would have company. We two would pray for him night and day.
while he was away, would we not, Aunt Lo�z? Ah, if he would be wise!".
By this time the women were close together, holding each other's.
weep a little with one who loved her son, when all others were against.

"If I could only see him and speak to him! But he is so hard to.
"This is what makes it all so strange. I know he is so brave, braver.

the Emperor calls for his children, he stays. When all the others take.
to blame. Ah, he is a wicked man, that, and no friend to the good.
Arfoll, too, she was agreed, as we have seen. She could not understand.

"Thou art a good girl," she said, "and I would wish no better for my.

village. The wind was still rising upon the sea, and the sea, although.

Instead of turning inland up the main street of the village, Marcelle.

This was the lower village, exclusively devoted to the fishing.

standing in the doorway and looking down at the busy fingers, she.

A faint colour came into the girl's cheeks as she spoke, but her face,.
was a distant relation, brought the little one back with her from.
"What news?" she said, looking up quickly, after a pause.
"None. Aunt Lo�z does not know where he is. He has not been near home.
for many nights, and she is growing afraid.".

They were talking, of course, of Rohan; but the personal pronoun was.

served so by all his children, for whom he has done so much; he would.
"Perhaps he is afraid," sighed Guineveve "Well, it is no wonder!".
"If I thought it was that," she cried, "I should hate him for ever and.

"I have news, Marcelle! He is not far away!".
Marcelle was about to utter a cry, when he placed his hand upon her.
"Hush! Come within, for the rain is heavy;" and when they were.
busily before the fire, he added, "He was seen at Ploubol yesterday,.
and a man recognised him, and he was nearly taken. He struck down the.
gendarmes, and that will make his case worse. There is no escape; he.
must soon be caught. He was last seen going in the direction of.

"Well, they are posted up along the road, and there is one on the.

He had not told her, however, of the sight he had seen with his own.
sticking up with his own hands the paper that was now to be seen on.
Marcelle was not one of those maidens who wear their hearts on their.

She did not speak now, but, leaning her forehead against the door,.
There was no answer, but a heavy sigh, and the pale firm face wore an.

"I must go now," she said quietly. "Mother will wonder where I am.".

would scarcely have thought that she had any care.
Yet the great Sea was rising and crying behind her as she went, and.
before her soul a storm was spreading, more terrible than any sea.
Chapter 20. "THE POOL OF THE BLOOD OF CHRIST".
A few days after the medical inspection of the conscripts, the order.
The experiences of the previous year had not brought the Emperor.

enormous scale than ever. The loss of 500,000 men, with all their.
Our story at present, however, concerns not the movements of great.

At last came the eve of the departure, and the conscripts were to set.
There was a busy gathering that night in the Corporal's kitchen.

"When you have once smelt powder, it will be all right," returned.
their uncle; "and the best of it is, you will do that at once. There.
will be no delay, no worry--you are going straight to the Rhine--.

Late that evening, while the company in the kitchen were drinking,.

The moon was at the full, but vast clouds driven by a high wind.
from time to time, and between the showers the moon looked out with a.
this time breathless with speed, and her eyes looked from side to side.
obviously familiar to her, and, though she tripped several times, she.
By this time she had left the village a mile and a half behind. She.
Another shower came, blotting out the light of the moon, and the wind.

creeping forward to the base of the Cross, she found a basin of blood-.
Now, this solitary basin, called in the dialect of the country the.

superstition that if a man or woman went thither when the moon was.

she meant to give them one each, without explaining, of course, that.

She turned again sharply, but the darkness was great and she saw.
nothing. Crossing herself again, she began to run.
That moment she again heard the footsteps behind her.

"You saw me! Then you have broken my charm.".
"Not at all," answered Rohan, very coldly. "I do not know your errand,.
and I could not see you when you knelt. It is a cold night for you to.
He spoke as if there was nothing between them, as if he were any.

She made a movement as if to go. He did not stir a step to follow her.
"It is strange to see you here; I thought you were far away. They are.

"Rohan! Rohan! why do you speak to me like that?".
"We did not know what had happened--I have been heart-broken--Gildas.

after his cold lips came down and were quite close to hers, she cried,.
"Ah, my Rohan, I knew thou wouldst be wise. It is not too late, and.
She looked up in his face with passionate confidence and hope, and as.
that--it is not that I have changed my mind. I cannot come down; I.
will never give myself up, alive!".
"Why, then, have you come back to Kromlaix?".
"To see thee! To speak to thee once more, whether I live or die!".

thee day and night; thou wilt die. Mother of God, Son of God!--yes,.

Heaven, and I shall come to thee and kiss thee there.".
"I cannot go--it is an oath. Farewell!".
"Rohan, speak! for God's sake, stand up and speak! Is it true what.
they say--that you are afraid?".
He rose to his feet and looked at her strangely.
"It is all true," he answered. Had it been day she might have seen a.
will not go to war, because--well, because I am afraid?".
He did not explain his fear, for, had he done so, she could not have.
"It is best that you should understand at once, for ever, that I will.
never fight as soldiers fight; that is against my heart; and that I am.
love might tempt me; but I have not the courage to do what you bid me.
There, you are shivering--it is so cold. Hasten home!".
Had she been wiser in the world, she might have guessed that he who.
But she was not wise, and his own confession, corroborating the.
"Marcelle, will you not give me your hand again? Will you not say.
She paused, but said nothing. He seized her hands, and kissed her.
thee; but if evil comes to me, do not think of me in anger. Perhaps.
God will be good, and some day you may think better of me. Farewell,.
He had turned away sobbing, when she caught him by the arm, crying.

till the hour for summoning his nephews, and then afterwards to see.
them a short distance upon the road.
with her he held dearest in all the world, yet as resolved as ever in.
The passionate love in his heart fought fiercely against the cold.
less sweet, he knew, many a man would have given his salvation.
He had not slept for two nights and days, during which he had been.
back to the CROSS, and there, resting his head against the stone,.
partially sheltered from the rain by the stone figure above, and.
And as he slept he dreamed a dream.
He seemed, in his dream, to be still lying on the spot where he had.
fallen asleep, with his eyes fixed on the crucified figure above him.
listening in fascination for he knew not what.
for he had been startled by a strange movement above him, by a.
He listened more intently, and this time his ears were startled by a.
horror and terror, the figure on the Cross was moving its head from.
but as a sleeper moves his head, slowly awakening from a heavy sleep.

sought to utter a cry, but the sound was frozen in his throat. For a.
moment, as it seemed, he became unconscious. When he looked again, the.
Cross above was empty, and the figure was standing at the foot.
breath; and he said in a low voice, "Rise!".
from him, and he gazed up into the Face, but spoke no word. And the.
worshipped, not in terror now, but in joy.
Then the Christ said, "Follow me!".
The night was black, but a dim light ran before them on the ground.
his dream, that he moved with no volition of his own, but as if.
earth beneath their feet swept past them like a wind-blown sea.
At last, passing through the wide paths of a cultivated wood, and.
The Figure passed on and stood before the door, uplifting his hand.
The door opened and he entered in, and Rohan followed close behind.
When the eyes of his soul opened again, he was crouching in the shadow.
Before them, with his back to them, writing busily at a table, sat a.
Man. The room in which he wrote was an antechamber, and through the.
him, and leaving all the rest of the chamber dim.
Man; but it remained hidden, bent over the table. Hours seemed to.
but the lamp still burnt on the table, though the shape of the Man was.
with His breath, this one word, "Read!".
He crossed the chamber, he bent above the table. It was covered with.
which the ink was scarcely dry, and it contained only two words, his.
As he read, in his dream, he felt the confused sick horror of a man.
on cottage walls;--the face of the great Emperor.
that Rohan thought in his dream, "He does not sleep, but is dead." And.
woman's, a small hand clenched like a sleeping child's.
In that moment of wonder he turned his eyes, and found himself alone.
Emperor, watching, and shivering from head to foot.
Strangely enough, the supernatural presence had been a source of.
and helplessness possessed him, and he would have flown; but he could.
not move--he could not turn his eyes away. To be there alone with the.
Emperor lying as if dead--was too much for his soul to bear; he.
of his dream, he uttered a wild cry. The Emperor did not stir, but in.
but was still helpless, as the feet came nearer and nearer; and while.
the doors of the ante-chamber were burst open, and a haggard light of.
to take his life, he swooned away--and woke.
wet with the long night's rain.
He was about to rise to his feet and crawl away to some securer.
passed close by the Cross, but down in the hollow of the road. Rohan.
friends and fellow villagers, were on their way by dawn to join the.
From that day forth, for many days and weeks, the fate of Rohan.

without avail. The last occasion on which he had been publicly seen.
was on that memorable night of the Conscription, when he made his.

before the departure of the conscripts.

It was terrible to think of--it was worse even than death itself! Her.
physical strength and beauty, on the power and dignity of his nature,.
is strong; and now! It was almost inconceivable to think that he was.
times, "Perhaps I do not understand." Something in the looks, the.
words, made her feel, as she had often felt before, the influence of a.
a fierce enemy of her convictions, and of the great Imperial cause--.
of that had lasted for one whole day, we verily believe that.
almost have been ready to strike her lover down.
Well, coward or chouan, or both, he had disappeared, and if he lived,.
could find no scent of the fox in or out of the village. A hundred.
spies were ready to claim the reward, but no opportunity came. At last.
either by leaping from one of the high cliffs, or by drowning himself.
in the sea. As weeks passed by and no traces of the fugitive were.
But she had her mother to comfort--the work of the house to do--the.
to sit like a lady of romance, with her hands folded before her and.
indications of a settled design. True, all he did was to drop in of a.
possessions, and a close inquiry into the amount of the bride's dower.
morals of course were a minor matter, and he was in all other respects.
his head, set on broad shoulders, was too small for symmetry; and.
went about with a smile--the smile of secrecy, and of satisfaction.
that his secrets were so well kept.
whatever he did, he spared no pains to insure success; and when he had.
And so when he began to "woo," Marcelle at once took the alarm; and.
tried to make some excuse for leaving the house, and when she was.
Strange to say, he no longer met with the fiery indignation which had.
horrible fear and despair. She was listening for a voice out of the.
sea or from the grave, and even in her sleep she listened, but the.
in his temples like a roll of drums, and his thoughts far away. As the.
attitudes about the chamber; and leaning against the wall, not far.
Though the season was early summer, they were holding a sort of.
at him as if curious to hear his reply, the mother with a little.
arrangement between the Emperor and the Holy Father! There are some.
silver and gold, and was honoured as a saint. Do not mistake, m'sieu.
who speak? Have I not seen with my own eyes, heard with my own ears?
"Right, Uncle Ewen!" he exclaimed: "he has made them dance, those.
"You do not know it, you others," pursued the veteran; "but it is a.
grand thing to look on a man like that--to look upon him--to talk with.
him--to feel his breath about you!".
"As you have done, Corporal!" said the priest approvingly.
"As I have done!" said the veteran proudly, and with no shame in his.
pride. "Yes, I who stand here! I have been with him face to face,.
Cismone, then twice again. I can see him now; I can hear his voice as.
over the open camp. I think if he came and spoke again like that above.
and, puffing vigorously, applied it to the bowl of his pipe, which had.
The veteran, still smoking, turned his eye quietly on the speaker, and.
"How many years ago was that little affair of Cismone?".
fire with his wooden leg; and finally, turning round again to the.
rubbing his hands hard together, he replied in a voice that might have.
seventeen hundred and ninety-six.".
If the words had been a spell, the company could not have looked more.
thrilled and awed. To be quite candid, we must admit that the.
announcement was a familiar one, and had been made, with its.
many and many a night before. But some stories are ever new, and this.
Every one present that night had heard it a dozen times, yet each one.
was bright and cheerful; for he, of course, had no dread of the.
Conscription, which was still overshadowing the heart of his grown-up.
The grenadier, full of that rarest of all emotions--the pride of a.
as he spoke the figures around him again and again faded, and his eye.
searched the distance in a sort of waking dream.
of the dawn. It was a long march, ten leagues of infernal country; a.
forced move, you see. In the evening we reached a village,--the name I.
have forgotten, but a quaint little village on a hill. That night we.
were so weary that we could not have kept awake, only the word had run.
along the lines that the Emperor--oh, he was only a general then!--.
that General Bonaparte was with us. Well, we knew that it was true,.
for we could feel him, we could swear that he was near. In the.
hospitals, father, the doctor goes from bed to bed, touches the.
quicker at his coming, and slower at his going. Well, that is the way.
heart! she was not thinking of the Emperor, but of her two great sons,.
"The moon was still up when we marched again in the morning. We were.
cut off the retreat, and thousands laid down their arms. That would.
have been enough for an ordinary general, but the Little Corporal was.
the word to halt, it was welcome news.".
"Now, I had a comrade in those days--a tall fellow, with a cast in his.
eye, but as good as gold--and his name was Jacques Monier, and he was.
sup, and many a night lay in each other's arms for warmth. Well, on.
fire we had kindled on the bare ground, and I had gone to find water.
When I returned Jacques was standing on his feet, holding in his hand.
half a loaf of black bread, and beside him, in the light of the fire,.
head to foot with mud and rain--he looked like any common soldier--but.
I knew him at once. He was warming his hands over the fire, and.
Jacques was saying, as he held out the loaf, 'Take it all, my.
General!' As I saw that, I looked into the General's face, and it was.
but that such an expression of feeling was appropriate.
"'Take it all,' said Jacques; 'half a loaf is not much.' Well, you.
should have seen the General smile. He did not answer, but he took the.
bread into his hands, and broke off a morsel and began to eat, handing.
tin pot half full of water, and I emptied into it a little brandy that.
I had saved in my flask, and I handed the pot to the General. Here it.
is--the same--I keep it still as a souvenir.".
asked us our names, and we told him. Then he looked hard at us over.
and over again, wrapped his cloak around him, and went away. So.
brandy and water, and talked of the Emperor till we fell to sleep.".
General remembered you for that service, no doubt?".
"The General remembers everything," he replied. "Nine years afterwards.
"Nine years!" ejaculated the cur�. "It was a long time to wait,.
Corporal. Did he give you no reward?".
"What reward would you give for a crust of bread and a drop of brandy,.
General had more to think of; and it all passed like a dream. Not that.
we missed our reward at last. When the time came he remembered well.".
"Yes, yes, let us hear all about it!" cried Father Rolland.
"It was in the year 1805, at the camp of Boulogne. Great changes had.
thought the General had forgotten all about us, and what wonder if he.
had, seeing how busy he had been knocking off the crowns of your.
front. That day of the coronation was fixed for a general distribution.
of crosses and medals. Such a day! The mist was coming in from the sea.
like smoke from a cannon's mouth. On the rising ground above the town.
before the throne was the sea. When the Emperor sat down on the.
you would have said it was the waves of the sea roaring. But look you,.
at that very moment the smoke of the sea parted, and the sun glanced.
sight is seen but once in a lifetime; I should have to talk all night.
to tell you a tenth of the wonders of that day. But I am going to tell.
passing by--we were in the front ranks, you observe--he stopped short,.

then his face lighted up, and he came quite near. This is what he.
said--ah, that I could give you his voice!--'Come, I have not.
looking in our direction. Well, then, the great Emperor turned to us,.
and gave us each the Cross from his own hand, and saluted us as.
Corporals. I will tell you this--my eyes were dim--I could have cried.
like a girl; but before we could know whether we stood on our heads or.
in the bowl of his pipe, while a subdued murmur ran round the.
"I have been told that a good shepherd can tell the faces of every one.
of his flock, but this is more wonderful still. How long, do you say,.
"Nine years," answered the Corporal.
much to do, how much to think of! Ah, he is a great man! And was that.
the last time," he added, after a short pause, "that your eyes beheld.
"I saw him once more," said the Corporal, "only once.".
"It was only a month or two later--the first day of December. It was.
A thrill ran through the assembly at the mention of the magic name.
"We were crouched, seventy or eighty thousand of us, watching and.
fires were crimson. In the middle of it all I saw him riding past The.
left nor right. He rode a white horse, and Jacques said he looked like.
at the joke, which was a too familiar one.
"And you never saw him again," said the cur�; "that was the last.
The Corporal nodded his head slowly and repeatedly, in the manner of a.
followed by four or five gendarmes, rushed into the room.
"Soul of a crow!" cried the Corporal, "what is the matter?".
The cur� rose from his seat by the fire.
"One would say," he exclaimed, "that the good Sergeant had seen a.
round the room, until he at last found voice.
"Take that, comrade," he said, with a nod; "it is better than water.
is all this about? and who is this that you have seen?".
there ever a soul here can swear to the man's clothes, for, look you,.
"If a ghost can wear clothes, these belong to him. Well, it is all the.
same now; he will never need them more.".
The articles of attire were passed from hand to hand, but there was.
nothing to distinguish them specially as the property of the fugitive.
The coat was torn down the back, as if in a severe scuffle.
"His blood be on his own head. It is no fault of mine." The fierce.
"What do you mean?" she cried. "You have not--".
"It is not that," he answered. "Old Pipriac is bad, but not so bad as.
that, my dear. Malediction! is he not his father's son, and were not.
Emperor, I have not hurt a hair of the villain's head.".

"I will tell you all about it," he said; "you and the Corporal and all.
here. You know, we had given him up as dead; we had searched heaven.
for him but the bottom of the sea. Well, you may guess it was on quite.
is neither here nor there: we were coming along by the great stone up.
we saw close to us in the moonlight, with his back to us, a man. I.
knew him in a moment, though I could not see his face; but I will tell.
you frankly this--when he turned round and looked at us I thought it.
"He is no nephew of mine," growled the veteran, but his voice.
"I don't know how it happened, but we were upon him in a moment--I,.
he shook off the rest like so many mice. Before we knew it he was.
had dropped his gun, and his hat had fallen off and he was screaming.
to us to help him: the deserter could not shake him off. We fixed our.
marble, her large eyes fixed on the speaker's face.
When we seized him again, we were not ten yards from the edge of the.
great crag--you know it--it is like a wall. The tide was in, high.
spring tide, and the water was black far down below. We fell upon him,.
all six of us, and soon had him down; it took all our strength, I can.
tell you. Well, we had him safe and he could not stir.".
"It is all very well to cry 'Bravo!'" said the irascible Sergeant,.
"but let me tell you the devil himself could not hold him! He lay for.
a minute quite still, and then he began to wriggle. You are a.
fisherman, and have tried to hold a conger eel; well, it was like.
that. Before we knew what he was about, he had wriggled almost to the.
"We were six to one, I say, but for all that we could not stop him. I.
others gripped his arms and legs. But when I saw what he was about--.
when I heard the black sea roaring right under us--my heart went cold.
I saw there was but one way, and I loosened one hand and seized the.

himself out of his jacket, torn himself loose, and was on the very.
edge of the crag. Heaven, you should have been there! The loose earth.

pitch-dark below, and we could see nothing. But we listened, and we.
"Not he--he had no breath left in him for that; he went down to his.
death as straight as a stone, and if he escaped the rocks he was.
drowned in the sea. Corporal Derval, don't say it was any fault of old.
Pipriac's! I wanted to save him, damn him! but he wouldn't be saved.
In the scuffle I touched him; but that was an accident, and I wanted.

where I hurt him in the struggle.".

all that, I am sorry I wounded him. This upon the jacket must be.

but even then she did not swoon.
Pipriac, after a pause. "Yes, it is blood, and no mistake!".
the light, and showed it moist and red.
uttering a sound, dropped down as if dead upon the floor.
Early the next morning, when it was morte mer, or dead low water, a.
whose form the reader is already familiar. Looking down from time to.
Right at the foot of the crag lay fragments of loose earth and rock,.
was no trace. At high water, however, the tide washed right up against.

great a horror was still upon her, and she could not yet realize the.
killed by the fall before he reached the sea; on reaching it, his body.
into the deep water. There was very little chance of finding it for.
some days; and, indeed, it might never rise to the surface or be.
where he is, down there, as buried up yonder with a bullet in his.
heart. He would have been shot, you see, and he knew that. Don't say.
and, taking into consideration the nature of the catastrophe which had.
was shining on the sea, and in her own sweet face, but she was.
who was speaking in a low voice as she appeared, but grew silent as.
It was very strange, but the widow showed no sign of absolutely.
to the ground; perhaps its very horror upheld her for the time being.
"There is no hope," she said in a low voice; "it is all as they said,.
"I was there this morning before them all; I could not find a trace.
A month had passed since that memorable night of the struggle on the.
heart. In that season to live at all was pleasant, but to live and be.
There was a green dell in the meadows behind the cliffs, and in this.
custom, which excludes from the festival young people under the age of.
a blade of corn, and on the breast of every girl was a flower of flax,.
with or without an accompaniment of wild heath and flowers.
flowers; and behind them came a group of young men, bearing on their.
hat in his hand, and his round face was brown as a satyr's, and he was.
It was, however, an almost unprecedented thing to behold Father.
enough to interfere with the innocent happiness of the day, had never.
unexpected, however, and he was greeted on every side with a pastoral.
a group of girls, who greeted her by name and made room for her beside.
they all laughed and clapped their hands.
"Boys and girls," he said in Brezonec, "do you know what has brought.
me here? You cannot guess--so I will tell you. It is simple enough and.
very sad. It is right for you to make merry, mes garz, because you are.
young, and because there will be a good harvest; but it is also right.
and all the other members of the gathering crossed themselves too.
"Sad events have taken place since last you gathered here; many have.
been taken away by the Conscription, some have died and been buried,.
and some are sick; but it is not of any of those that I want to speak,.
but of the poor garz who was your patron last year, and who is now--.
himself and of the blessed Virgin!".
Again, automatically, they made the sign of the cross, even little.
custom every year for the young people to choose among themselves a.
sort of king and queen, who led the sports and reigned for the day,.
translate the dialect of the country, "patron" and "patroness.".
"I am not going to praise or blame him who is gone; he was foolish,.
perhaps, and wrong; though for all that he came of a fine family, and.
was a pleasure to look at for strength. Well, he is dead, and there is.
an end--peace to his soul! Now that you are so merry, don't forget him.
and is too heart-broken, I am sure, to join you to-day.".
"I am here, Father Rolland," she said, as she met his eye.
to cast off care; it is courageous, and I am pleased.".
satisfied to hear that she had stayed away.
"I did not think of coming at first," she said, approaching close,.
here to-day, and will never be here again, but I know what would have.
Guineveve to be patroness; and that is my wish, too.".
There was a moment's silence, then came a loud crying and clapping of.
hands. "Yes, yes!" cried the groups of men and girls, only a few.
is a girl in a thousand. Well boys and girls, is that your choice?".
already, seated on a knoll in the midst of a garland of girls,.
happiness, light in her face, joy in her heart, flowers on her breast.
her, looking down into her eyes with perfect admiration and love.
to herself, "No one must know! I will creep away as soon as I can, for.
silence as he prayed. It was done in a minute, and before they could.
all rise up again the priest was trotting away back to the village.
It was the custom for the new patron and patroness to lead off the.
steps with heel and toe, till the eyes grew dizzy to look at them.
"Marcelle, will you not dance?" said a voice in her ear.
She was standing looking on like one in a dream when she heard the.
voice, and she did not turn round, for the tones were familiar.
"Going home, and the sport has only just commenced! But you will try.
your charm on the love-stone before you go?".
It was the custom on that day for every single woman to leave a flower.
of flax, and every single man a blade of corn, on the stone of the.
their depositors are faithful; if they wither before the week is out,.
And truly, in a little time she had slipped away from the company,.
"You shall not soil your fingers or carry a load--no, not even a drop.
visit my uncle who keeps the cabaret, and you shall have shoes and new.
height of a Breton mother's ambition is to have a son in the.
enough of my own. I have set my heart upon it... You should see the.
as silk and white as snow--it would do your heart good, it smells so.
"I know why you treat me so. You are thinking of that chouan of a.
"If he was a chouan, you are worse. He is dead--his soul is with God:.
and it is like you to speak of him so.".
Mikel saw his blunder, and hastened to retrieve it, if possible.
"Do not be angry, for I did not mean it. Rohan Gwenfern was a good.
fellow; but, look you, he is dead--besides you were cousins, and the.
finger is worth more silver than his whole body. I am a warm man, I,.
though I say it that should not.".
More he uttered in similar strain, but all to the same effect. At last.
he left her and returned to the gathering, angry with himself, with.
her, with all creation. For her last words to him were, as she passed.
down into the village. "Go back and choose a better; I shall never.
marry but one man, and that man is lying dead at the bottom of the.
There was no moon, and, although it was summer-tide, a black veil.
on rock and sand. There was not a breath of wind, and the men were.
Now, as we have seen before, the Cathedral was well known to be.
a prayer, for the very spot was perilous. In a moment they were.

vanished, and the whole Cathedral was in pitch darkness. Sick,.
They had seen enough; for in that moment of horror they had not only.
veracity of the eye-witnesses; indeed, everybody was only too ready to.
glimpses of the moon; but he had never before, within the memory of.
"He had two great eyes, each as red as a boat lantern," said one of.
The speaker was lying on the shingle surrounded by a group of men and.
"Made him go through his confession?" echoed one of the group.
"How do you know that, old Evran? You could not hear?".
the Saint puts upon him whenever he catches him on holy ground.".
"It is strange enough. A torch in his hand, you said?".
"And the Saint--you saw him quite plain?".

"Suppose, after all, it had been a man!".
"A man!" he echoed. "Holy saints keep us, a man!".
had been guilty of some horrible blasphemy.
"A man in the Cathedral of St. Gildas at dead of night!" he exclaimed,.
with a contemptuous laugh. "A man as tall as a tree, shining like.
character of a pious man, and did not care to lose it.
"Oh, I say nothing!" he observed. "Such things have been, and the.
Cathedral is a dreadful place. But is it not strange that the Saint.
group behind him, the old salt observed, shrugging his shoulders--.
"Mikel Grallon used to be a sensible man; but he is in love, you see,.
and perhaps that is why he talks like a fool.".
Grallon was no fool; he was only a very suspicious man, who never took.
religion wherein he had been born and bred. Physically, he was timid;.
of the vision in the Cathedral, he would possibly have shared the.
Now, he had not exaggerated in the least when he had said that that.
By means of innumerable little attentions, not the least of which lay.
were repeated over and over again, and which had invariably the same.
as youths love. He might, therefore, be said with justice to be.
already an approved suitor in the eyes of the whole family.
less headstrong, the betrothal would have been as good as concluded.
selected for her, to leave all the preliminaries in their hands, and.
only at the last moment to come forward and behold the object of the.
inclinations, and was not likely to alter her habits when choosing a.
number he might be living yet; but he is dead, and I have killed him;.
"Soul of a crow!" he said, "have you no courage? She sees you too.
little--let her know that you mean to win. Girls' hearts are taken by.
storm; but you have not the spirit of a fly.".
"It is no use, Uncle Ewen. She is thinking too much of one that is.
conscience, he did not care to discuss the subject. Under any other.
Conscription had been unleashed, and the man, his own flesh and blood,.
had been hunted down to death,--and now, after all, silence was best.
It cannot be denied that at this period the Corporal showed an.
approaching the Ladder of St. Triffine, he found himself face to face.
basket for you? You must be tired.".
As he held out his hand to take her burthen from her, she drew back.
"God's mercy, mother! you are pale as death--you have caught fever,.
As he spoke, he watched her with a look of extraordinary penetration,.
struggling all this time for breath, and at last she found her speech.

simply; "at your age, mother, you should rest. Look you, that is what.
all the neighbours say is strange.".
"What is strange?" asked the woman sharply.
"A little while ago you were for ever sitting by the fire or busy in.
the cottage; not even on a holiday did you cross the door; and we all.
for ever wandering up and down as if you could not rest in peace.".
shivering--"since they killed my boy.".
"But, mother, in such weather!".
"When one has a broken heart, wind and rain cannot make it better or.
As the tall figure of the old woman disappeared in the direction of.
shore, walked quickly along the beach, and came as close as possible.
to the Cathedral: but the tide was too high for a passage round to the.
Gate. So he stood on the water's edge, like one in profound.
meditation; then, as if an idea had suddenly occurred to him, he began.
over a patch of sand, soft as wax to take any impression left upon it;.
and there, clear and unmistakable, was the print of a naked human.
his sight, and when night came was not far from the door. It thus.
that, to escape his company, she would return again into her cottage,.
And whenever he slept, some other pair of eyes was on the watch; for.
he had a confidant, some nature silent as his own.
He was moving one evening along the cliffs, not far from the scene of.
village, when he suddenly became aware of a figure moving close by him.
and towards the verge of the crags. Now, it had grown quite late, and.
the moon had not yet risen, but there was light enough in the summer.
backward like a ghost. For a moment his heart failed him, for he was.
shape. Too late; it had disappeared, as if over the very face of the.
death had been found some weeks before.
Strange to say, this time also, but not until he had recovered from.
and his reputation as a confirmed night-bird spread far and wide. "I.
something on his mind, and he is thinking far too much of the old.
mackerel did not alter him; for, instead of taking his seat as captain.
of his own boat, he put another man in his place, and received only.
his one share as owner of the boat. He had the air of a man for ever.

presence of mind ran to the door, which had been left wide open, and.
discovered it by the merest chance. True, I have suspected it for a.
long time, but now I know it for a certainty.".

"I am not one of those who go about seeing ghosts, mother; and I know.
the difference between spirits of air and men of flesh and blood. Go.
"In the Cathedral!" echoed the Corporal.
"There, or close at hand; of that I am certain. I have tracked him.
thrice, and thrice he has disappeared into the Cathedral; but I was.
alone, see you, and I did not care to follow too close, for he is.
desperate. I should have put my hand upon him once, but he walks the.
cliffs like a goat, and he went where I could not follow.".
he was not dead at all; since to be alive was still to be in open arms.
doomed man, who might be seized and shot like a dog at any moment.

"If you have not spoken, then remember--his life is in your hands,.
and, if he is discovered through you, his blood will be upon your.
head, and the just God will punish you.".
that he suspects! Look you, you must not blame me if he is found, for.
other men have eyes as well as I. Ever since that night of the vision.
in the Cathedral, they have been on the watch; for it is clear now.
that it was not the blessed Saint at all, but a mortal man, Rohan.
brought his information in person at all. The truth is, he had.
calculated, under cover of that explosion, on playing the part of an.
innocent and sympathetic friend of the family; but finding that all.
looked at him with suspicion and horror, as on one who had conjured up.
some terrible phantom, and who was responsible for all the.
"But it is incredible!" he exclaimed. "Out there among the cliffs,.
with no one to bear him food, a man would starve!".
"One would think so," said Grallon; "but I have seen his mother.
among the sea-birds and the rock-pigeons. At all events, there he is,.
and the next thing to ask is, What is to be done?".
"Have I not just discovered it, and to whom should I speak? If you.

"Open!" said the voice; and heavy blows on the door followed.
"Who is there?" cried Marcelle, running over to the door with her hand.
"In the name of the Emperor!" was the reply.
She threw open the door, and in ran Pipriac, armed, and followed by a.

"Tous les diables!" he cried, "why is your door locked at mid-day, I.
ask you, you who are honest people? Do you not see I am in haste?
"Here," answered the old man, straightening himself to "attention,".
"It is strange news I bring you--news that will make you jump in your.
skins; I cannot linger, but I was passing the door, and I thought you.
Grallon! I have a message for you; you must come with us and have some.
"What is the matter, comrade?" asked the Corporal in a husky voice.
"This--the dead has risen; ha, ha! what think you of that?--the dead.
has risen! It is more wonderful than you can conceive, comrade, and.
you will not know whether to be sorry or glad; but your nephew, the.
defy you to kill him! Well, he is alive, and that is why we are here.

"How do you know he is alive? Have you seen him with your eyes!".
"You have had information!" she echoed in the same low voice.

duty, that is all. It is no fault of mine, comrades. But I must not.
The fisherman stood still, not meeting the angry eyes of the girl, but.
holding his hand to his head as if in stupor.
"and you cannot deceive me any more. Go! You are an ingrate--you are a.
wretch--you are not fit to live.".

and in reticence, but that she could not bear the storm of her own.
a wild cry, threw her arms up in the air, and then, for the second.
Out there among the cliffs, midway between the top of the precipice.
It is one of those dark summer afternoons, when the heavens are misted.
with their own breath, and a cold blue-grey broods upon the sea, and.
there is no stir at all, either of sunshine, or wind, or wave. The.
roar of the sea can be heard miles away inland; all is so very still;.
as a raven, yet white and beautiful as a dove.
Where the man sits, there is a niche in the cliff; a dizzy path leads.
under heaven, the great natural Cathedral, and the man from where he.
rises erect, puts his finger and thumb between his teeth, and gives a.
his features are darkened and distorted with exposure to the elements,.
in rags. His shirt is torn open at the shoulder, and his feet are.
type of the prim�val woods, rather than a rational and a peaceful man.
the top of the cliff. It is a small basket, attached to a long and.
when it reaches him he pulls gently at the cord, as a signal to the.
the basket, thus emptied of its contents, rapidly re-ascends.
Even now he seems in no hurry to go, but takes his siesta, watching.
away look in his eyes, which are gentle still, despite the worn and.
beneath him rises up to his seat, and the great roar is in his ears,.
but he is too familiar with these things to heed them now; he is.
to descend the dangerous path which leads to the shore; but, as he.
at last discovered him and are again upon his track.
behind them came excited groups of the population--men, women, and.
blind, so stupid? What have you got in your basket--tell me that?
Where do you come from? where are you going? Malediction! stand and.
listen. Come, answer, where is he? The Emperor is anxious about his.
The old woman, now white as death, and with her lips quite blue,.
looked fixedly in the Sergeant's face, but made no reply.
"So you are dumb, mother!--well, we shall find you a tongue. It is.
treated him fairly--you have led him up and down like a fool. Things.
like that cannot go on for ever; the Emperor has a long nose to scent.
you think to deceive the Emperor?".
away at the head of his myrmidons, and women from the village came up.
a word. All her soul was busy praying that the good God, who had.
and preserve him again in the hour of his extremity.
Leaving the majority of the stragglers behind them, and accompanied.
and the gendarmes pursued their way rapidly along the edges of the.
of some twenty in all, and among them there could be counted no friend.
to the hunted man; indeed, who would have dared, in those days of.
Rohan, now that it was discovered that he still lived; for the old.
prejudice against him had arisen tenfold, and not one was there,.
responsible for his own actions.

depths, went round like a wheel, and he drew back with an expletive.
down, the rocks were loosening, and the grass was slippery as ice.
standing on a portion of the cliffs which ran out, by a green ascent,.
"Listen," said Mikel. "The Cathedral is right under us, and I will.
peep over and try if anything is to be seen.".
pointed downward. He had gone as white as a sheet.
In a moment all their heads were hanging over the precipice, and all.
to the left, they saw the roofless walls of the cathedral of St.
"Right under, with his face looking down upon the sea.".
looked up again, was one of horror and amaze.
"He is the Devil!" said the Sergeant. "No man could walk where he has.
"It was horrible to look at!" said the gendarme Pierre.
others, that is all, and he is like a goat on his feet. You can guess.
now how he saved his neck that night when you fancied he was killed.
Well, he will soon be taken, and there will be an end of his pranks.".
mind, no bloodshed! If he should ascend, take him alive.".
"But if he should resist?" said one of the men.
before them and stood on the very edge of the cliff, gazing at them.
"It belongs to the mother of the deserter," said Grallon; "it is a.
fondling it as if it were a good Christian.".
after a moment's reflection over the odds, which were decidedly.
against her, she gave a scornful toss of her head and walked away.
upon the shore. Looking up when they reached the bottom, they saw.
Jannedik standing far up against the sky, on the very edge of the.
By this time it was growing quite dark in the shadow of the cliffs,.
recently descended; but after he had reached a height of some fifty or.
him, but he walks where no man ever walked before.".
Cathedral there is no path even for a goat to crawl. It is in the.
Another hour had elapsed, however, before the passage was practicable,.
"If we had brought a torch!" said Pierre.
There was a rush, a whirr, and a flock of doves, emerging from some.
this work, but to grope about in a dungeon is to waste time.".
their steps from the Cathedral, and were standing in the lighter.

zealous in his duty, he would just as soon have given the deserter.

walls are as straight as my hand; and the moss is so slippery and soft.
that no man could climb; and as to entering from above--why, see how.
Devil, we shall never lay hands upon him. Malediction!".
It certainly did seem incredible at first sight that any human being.
could have reached the Cave--if Cave it was--from above or from under,.

In the extreme corner of the Cathedral, close to what we have termed.
the Altar, the cliff was hard and dry, and here and there were.

"Then if he escapes, do not say that I am to blame," cried the.
fisherman, still in a low voice. "I would wager my boat, my nets, all.

at the moment--he had been up all night, without a drop of liquor to.

Another volley into the mouth of the Cave, given furiously at a signal.
Sunset comes, and nothing has been done; the situation seems actually.
unassailable. The rain has been falling more or less all day, and.
every man is wet through and out of temper. The crowd of villagers,.
the gendarmes are baffled at every turn.
The great Cathedral is empty, all is silent. But who is this that,.
Still there is silence, and, turning sadly, she walks down the dark.

Yes, he had heard; lying in there upon his bed of weeds, he had heard.
the voice, and peering down, himself in darkness, he had seen the.
enemies; but the excitement of the day had made him mad, suspicious,.
when she had gone, he threw himself down upon his bed and wept.
consciousness of all that he had lost, of all the love and peace that.
he had nearly won the certainty of what he was now, who had once been.
The name went up into the hollows of the Cave, and voices answered him.
All that night he was left in peace, but he knew well that close watch.
no other place was so safe, and his foot was still in pain. He rested.
in the total darkness, without a light of any kind; he heard the.
preparation for his enemies. Scattered on the floor of the Cave were.
carried to the mouth of the Cave, piling them one upon another in.
hours he laboured, for it was no easy task; some of the stones being.
done, his hands were bleeding, cut by the sharp edges of the stones.
Finally, when the tide crept into the place once more, he threw.
When he awoke it was broad day--the mouth of the Cave was bright, and.
the mouth of the Cave, now partially blocked up by the rocks and.
below him, a crowd of men, almost all of whom wore uniform and carried.
Again, the Mayor, holding a paper in his hand, called his name aloud.
After a moment's hesitation, he answered, "I am here!" There was a.
"You were drawn for the Conscription in the early summer, and your.
of need; there is no longer any chance of escape; why do you still.
"Do you hear me? Are you still refractory? Have you not one word to.
After a moment's pause, the voice from the Cave replied--.
"If I surrender as you desire, what then?".
The Mayor shrugged his shoulders.
"You will be shot, of course, as a warning to others.".
"Why, then, you will die too, but like a dog. There is but one law for.
deserters--one law and short shrift. Now, do you understand?".
"And to save trouble, will you surrender?".
air that said, "I have done my duty, and wash my hands of the whole.
affair." A long colloquy ensued, at the end of which the Mayor said,.
"The rest is in your hands, and should be easy; he is only one man,.

"What man is this?" asked the Mayor, scowling.
"This is the man who first gave information," said Pipriac. "Stand.
back, fisherman! What do you want?".
"The deserter is without means of subsistence. If the worst come to.
the worst, he must starve to death.".
the only question was whether to try at once to take the position by.
storm, or to wait patiently until such time as the deserter either.
returned empty-handed, after searching high and low, he saw the.
passively until such time as capitulation came. It should never be.

In the meantime, however, he sent to St. Gurlott for ladders, which.
might be useful sooner or later, if not for reaching the deserter.

the tide left the Cathedral quite out of the question for.

for the widow's last attempt to send succour to her son had failed,.
and now her very door was watched by cruel eyes. Ah, it was terrible!
to think that the son of her womb was out yonder starving in the.
night, that he had not tasted bread for many hours, that she was.
able to convey to him had been barely sufficient to support life, yet.
it had sufficed; but now!--a whole day and night had passed since she.
had vainly tried to reach him and had been discovered in the attempt.
Merciful God! to think of the darkness, and the cold, and the dreary.
solitude of the Cave; and then, to crown all, the hunger!

The man's eyes glitter as he bends over the descent, looking down at.
through the Gate, and out to the sea beyond. Scarcely has he passed.
the shadow of the Gate, however, when a gruff voice demands, "Who goes.
"The lantern! let us see her face!".
Some one lifts a lighted lantern from the bottom of the boat and.
What the foul fiend are you doing out here by the Gate at such an.
hour? Do you know what will be the consequence if you are discovered.

For a moment it appears to have missed, for the goat, though it seemed.

his attention was attracted by the rough tongue licking his hand.

brought. So long as she came to him, with or without tidings from the.
broken. Several times he had flung his arms around her neck, and.
almost wept, as he thought of the loving ones from whom she came, and.
her familiar presence, seen from day to day, had made the dark cave.
The poor beast knew her name and licked the hand of her master; then,.
forgotten for the time, in this new surprise and pain; he gazed on the.
The moon rose in the high heavens, but the wind had not abated, and.
the sea was still thundering on the shore. It was one of those wild.
autumn nights when there is a great shining in the upper air, with a.
as a beast's within him, and the man's brain was mad. As a wild beast.
One hour--two--passed thus. He seemed scarcely to see or hear.
of the sea and the shriek of the wind, he heard a startling sound. In.
a moment he sprang to the mouth of the Cave--and not too soon; for the.
in the moonlight, they shrank back with a loud cry.
Only for an instant; then they began to swarm up again.
fragments of rock which he had placed, ready for use, at the Cave's.
out of reach. Then a voice shrieked "Fire!" and a shower of bullets.
although his body was a constant target for their bullets, the.
But the patience of the besiegers had been long exhausted, and the.
suspension of attack was not destined to last long. Now that they.
their hand, they were determined, at any risk, to unearth the creature.
contrary, it facilitated them; and from time to time, when the moon.
told off for that purpose, a number of men again advanced to the.
behind the heap of rocks and stones which he had accumulated at the.
mouth of the Cave; so that, although he presented no mark for the.
rested against the face of the cliff, the defence began anew.
the safe part of the Cathedral; but as yet no man was dangerously.
dashed it down with incredible force and fury on one of the ladders.
Fortunately, no human being had reached the point where the rock.
turning again to his men, he cried, "Forward again! to the attack!".
Again the body of men moved forward under cover of fire, and again the.
lonely Cave, with the wild figure of a man coming and going across it.
like a ghost. To the cannonade of wind and sea, before which the.
from being carried twenty times over; for as the time flew, and the.
passed, and he still succeeded in keeping his enemies at bay; but his.
round, his eyes were blinded with fatigue, and he heard rather than.
Again and again the besiegers were repulsed; more than one was wounded.
Many hours had passed away when the besiegers made a final attack,.
more desperate than any that had taken place before. Advancing under.
cover of darkness, they set their ladder against the cliff, while.
their comrades covered the mouth of the Cave with their guns. In a.
tremendous strength. There was a flash--a roar--and once more the.
hurled back the ladder, and was in the act of discharging a fresh.
volley of stones, when he was startled by the apparition of two human.
With a shrill cry, the man fell backward into the crowd below;.
fortunately, his fall was broken by the moving, heaving mass, and.
was well-nigh exhausted and yielding rapidly to a species of vertigo.
over his head, and then, with a wild cry, hurled it downward at the.
How long he lay unconscious he could not tell; but when he opened his.
find himself face to face with his enemies, he started up and gazed.
around him, he saw no sign of any human being. The moon was out.
nearer and nearer to the great Altar. The silence was now explained.
The besiegers had withdrawn, as before, at the tide's approach, and.
left him master of the situation.
remaining in the Cathedral, and lacking the skill or power to ascend.
to the Cave, there would only have been one doom--a swift death in the.
Well, the battle was over, and he had conquered; and indeed properly.
provisioned for the purpose, and duly recovered from the effects of.
his long privation, he could have held the position for an indefinite.
from him. Hunger and cold had done their work, and the last citadel of.
and despair. He had held out bravely, but he felt that he could hold.
out no longer; he was safe for a little space, but he knew that his.
against him, as he had feared and believed from the beginning.
beheld for the first time, right under him in the moonlight, something.
prepared to descend the face of the cliff.
through the Gate with a roar like thunder and a snow-white flash of.
white face upturned to the sky.
was still there, touched by the glimmering fingers of the moon; and.
rising tide, was the body of a man.
The Battle was over, and he was the Victor, standing alone upon the.
field; and at his feet, the Slain.
as well as single; his enemies would not return that night, and they.
Bear in mind that Rohan, like all men of his race and religion, had.
True, he was vindicated by the circumstance that he had merely.
the air he breathed was sick and sacrificial. This, then, was the end.
of all his dreams of love and peace!
the face of the murdered man. In his terror he was saying that he.
party, looked upon him in the light of a deadly foe. He had been his.
he had only been doing his duty in attempting to secure a deserter.
truly as any of the rest. After all, thou wast a good fellow, and thy.
ankle-deep, and the tide has yet another hour to rise. With one last.

The date of that night is memorable. It was the 19th of October, 1813.

"That is not so," answered the Corporal firmly, looking very white.

"It is a sad thing, and it all comes, doubtless, of resisting the laws.

"And now no man will pity him, for there is blood upon his hands; and.
"Of course it is false; for what could he do? It is they who are to.
him, for he struck in self-defence, and he was mad. O my son, my son!".
They sat together in the cottage under the cliff, and they spoke, with.
blasphemy to have struck down the emissary of the great Emperor; and.
they knew that for such a deed, however justifiable, there would be no.

"The King of Saxony has deserted the Emperor, and the armies of France.

She did not reply, but her eyes were blind with tears; then he laughed.
vacantly, and looked down at his mother.
"I was starving, and so I came; they are busy up there, and they will.

There was something in his tone so reckless, so distraught, that they.

"No, Rohan, I am not afraid!" answered the girl, sobbing.

he drew the women to him with a low heart-broken cry.

His arms were around her, and his hot face was pressed close to hers,.

As the old man approached and bent above him, he did not stir; but.
