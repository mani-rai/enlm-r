Belmont Estate is on the market for $63 million and boasts roughly 22,000 square feet of luxurious finishes and elaborate architecture on 1.28 acres. Listed on Thursday, the home is being sold by high-end real estate firm Sotheby’s International Realty Canada.
“Within the city we’ve had homes that have sold for $56 million, $33 million, $31 million but this will be the record of the offering price,” listing agent Christa Frosch of Sotheby’s tells BuzzBuzzNews.
The three-storey home has five bedrooms, twelve bathrooms and an elevator in the west wing. Built to entertain, two main gallery halls can seat up to 100 guests. The Italian-inspired kitchen includes a fireplace and walls and ceilings throughout the home feature murals and artwork. Lavish amenities include an indoor pool and sauna, a six-car garage and a private entrance in-law’s suite.
Surrounding the property is a Versailles-inspired garden with a variety of trees, plants and an orchard. In the spring, over 12,000 flowers bloom in the tiered, three-level garden.
According to Frosch, the listing has received global attention and, despite being on the market for only 24 hours, buyers are already showing interest.
“We just went to the market yesterday, it’s private through Sotheby’s and we’ve already started to get calls,” says Frosch.
Stay well hydrated—that means you should include about 48- 64 ounces of liquid (non-calorie) each day. You will be drinking small amounts (“sips”) every hour through the day since you will not be able to drink a large amount all at once.
On Day Four after your surgery, begin adding liquid protein during this Phase (20 to 30 grams per day). That means you should buy a protein powder suggested by your dietitian, doctor or nurse. We recommend:
Unjury (20grams of whey protein isolate per packet) once a day (available at our office or www.UNJURY.com or 800-517-5111
Watch for signs of dehydration!
Review protein sources: meats, chicken, turkey, eggs, cheese, low fat milk, yogurt, tofu, soy beans, other legumes (beans)
You may use baby food without added sugar or starch such as baby food chicken, no blends such as chicken and rice.
You can eat fruits without sugar or syrup.
You may use a blender or food processor to keep foods soft.
Introduce new foods slowly and one at a time.
For extra protein add powdered milk (1/4 c) to your 1 cup of skim milk (this give about 18 grams of protein)
Taking vitamins will become a daily part of your life after gastric bypass surgery. We recommend:
Calcium Citrate, 1500 mg in 3 divided doses with Vitamin D 3 (2000 IU per day)
Continue to eat a high protein food at each meal such as lean meat or chicken
(50 grams of protein for women/ 60 grams for men), lean ground turkey is good choice for this phase
Use skim milk as a protein source (2 cups per day)
Get your lab work at 3 months, 6 months 1 year and yearly after surgery
See your surgeon for regular check-ups and lab work
Call or e-mail the nurse or dietitian if you have questions 412-741-8862
Hi, I'm Rudy. It will be ten years on June 21, 2014 I started on a remarkable journey; I had gastric bypass surgery.
Five months before that day, I was at my primary care physician's and he asked me if I ever thought of having bypass surgery. I never gave it a thought. I was on three blood pressure medications, cholesterol medicine, and 100 units of insulin every day. I had trouble breathing, just walking up a slight grade I had to use an inhaler.
Surgery went well. Recovery didn't take long and I was eating real food. I've been around 180 lbs. for 10 years now. I went from a 44 inch waist to a 34 inch waist. I feel strong and I have a lot more energy.
I don't use an inhaler anymore. I'm off all my blood pressure medications, cholesterol medicine and I went from 100 units of insulin down to 20 units of insulin a day.
At my heaviest, I weighed 283 lbs. and I have managed to keep 100 lbs. off for 10 years.
One thing I've learned is that I can leave food on my plate when I'm full.
Travelling alone can be a daunting prospect, not least to attend a wedding alone. The original plan had been to go with another neighbour, but she slipped a disc in her back and was unable to fly. Having fully absorbed the message from our esteemed Minister for Disabled People that everywhere is now fully accessible and disabled people don't need any extra money to pay for that perfect access I wasn't put off by such trivial concerns and on thursday I went to Ireland to see my lovely neighbour marry in her home town of Swinford.
Despite Maria's assurances of perfect access it seemed to take me much more time to arrange my travel and be more expensive than for the other guests. Travel Insurance cost double the standard amount, then there was arranging support at each airport before I went, which could only be confirmed on a 10p a minute phone line. The Bride had booked a hotel with access for the reception, in which I had to stay because whilst all the cheaper accomodation 'just over the road' was within comfortable drunken stumbling distance it certainly wasn't within any kind of deathwalking distance.
My neighbour had booked an accessible mini bus to take us from the airport to hotel which we eventually managed to find after a somewhat disturbing Mrs Robinson moment. There was a very attractive young man who looked in his early 20's on the flight who was also going to the wedding, who helped with my bag. I began to think it might be great fun until he told me had never flown alone before and his mum hadn't given him any money for the mini bus at which point I felt like a paedophile!
The mini bus journey was similar to the flight...with the added smell of old diesel for ambience. We all sat, in somewhat shell shocked silence, fighting the urge to vomit. Eventually we got to the hotel in Westport and then it got really tricky. But, I was in Ireland...so I offered up my prayers to Maria. I knew she'd fix it.
I'm really glad I got to see the bride and groom on their big day, but I can't help feeling that Maria really let me down. I had such faith in her, she tells us all often enough that everything's great and well...it kind of wasn't great. More a bit crap really. So next time I think I can travel alone, without any support I'll have to remember Maria and her magical misleading missives.
*Apologies to the people of Kerry who I'm sure are all very nice
If its any consolation, the Irish have Kerry-men as the but of all their jokes, with good reason.
Excellent post Kaliya, very well written. Sorry things didn't go better for you, not that it's not expected to anyway. This needs to be read by all in government, not that it would make any difference though. Loved your come back to Mr. offensive, don't know that I would have been so polite; TV and billboards need to run a campaign on educating people to the different disabilities and especially invisible disabilities, so sad that in this day and age there is so much ignorance around.
Thanks for posting this. I forget how sheltered I am by having a hubby in tow - or, no, what actually happens is that I conveniently blank out how hideous things were whenever he couldn't be there.
For our wedding we tried relatively hard to ensure accessibleness for our wheelchair using guest, although being in a listed building meant he couldn't get upstairs for the marriage ceremony. We visited the accommodation (100 yards away on the flat from the reception venue), measured it, photographed it, judged it according to the very useful criteria you have posted. But he declined to come, because he'd had such a horrendous time visiting other 'accessible' venues and finding out they weren't really.
He just couldn't risk the health consequences of turning up to find things weren't actually as he needed them. This is why it's such a tragedy that accessibility isn't thought through from the perspective of what people really need.
YOu look so beautiful (Then again you would look beautiful in sack cloth lol)
I rarely go out now - since i had my sticked kicked out from under me and the time they refused to sit down in a closed cafe in the local mall, since then my life has got smaller and smaller.
So life is very small. Friends are nowhere to be found and I wonder what I did to get this.
But - I am still alive at the moment so that is a plus, I love my family, and I live vicariously through others who blog LOLOL
I love you taking us with you on your adventures thorugh the accessible world of the UK...
Hope you are OK and have got over the stress of your trip now <3
Ah, now I understand the 'Ireland didn't go well' comment in your email earlier! Poor you, that wasn't much fun at all. I expect you were relieved to be home and on 'terra firma'!!
No extra costs for access? Asking for a disabled access hack if I want to take my chair (Quickie Ti - weighs little, I can just pick it up and put it in, no need for time-consuming ramps), to the pub here in Wirral jacks up the normal fair by about £1.50.
Not so, though, if I don't have my chair. Clearly discriminatory.
You should do a Rough Guide version of international travel!
The rude drunk - a classic example. I too admire your dignity in the face of adversity.
Katie price has tweeted for models all shapes or sizes! are you going to give it a go for all young disabled people as you certainly do sparkle. Just a thought?
Think she is becoming aware of all drawbacks as parents and herself are having to set up schmo as Harvey's is closing and they want the pupils to stay together cos of friendships and routine, as we all know how especially this is important.
Dear me, what an ordeal; you looked great though!
I miss the holidays, but I've accepted it now. I can't risk the knock on effect of months of even worse health than usual.
You were very brave to do what you did!
If you ever want to prove him wrong,I'm right here Bendy,at the back of this very long queue :D
He attracts all these girls who are over obsessed with him, HE IS JUST A 16 YEAR OLD BOY, he is human and no different to us boys. So why are girls obsessed with him!
Im a 15 year old boy, he also annoys me due to the fact that his boxers are always showing, do you know this originated from PRISON, guys used to pull there trousers too under their butt to show that they are free and wanting anul s*x
I'm g*y and have awesome gaydar. Kids a little q***r. As for him dating a girl...It's called playing straight. Did it for 5 years myself. It's the easiest game to play. Either way. Listen to real music that talks about real issues, not petty adolesent emotions. Dare to think think for yourself rather than eat the force fed s**t that everyone likes. I hope some of you are smarter than you appear to be..
people have there facts all wrong,his a boy not a girl,he never used those things which change your voice he just got better at it,he's nice,kind,sweet,awsome,cool,a great singer and caring,and that he is american and canadian,haven't you watched tv that you can be a person of two countries
-In all of his music videos, he portays himself at American. The American flag, the American dream, etc. I find it insulting he seems to want to hide his nationalistic pride for his home country (and mine), Canada.
-He flaunts all of his more famous associates and uses them as credibility.
-He pretends to be an activist for g*y rights, when he hides his own bisexuality from the press. (He is in fact bisexual. Ask anyone who knew him from before he became famous.)
-He uses voice enhancers (aka autotuners) for recordings and concerts. He is not as good a singer as many believe him to be (if you don't believe this, compare his early youtube uploads to his current songs)
2. he cant control that, so its pretty low.
and yeah im a boy,and no, im not g*y, im a nice guy. i dont love his songs or anything , but he's not that bad tbh.
he's an insult to real music. autotune does not mean you can sing well.
I don't think he's g*y I just don't like him:
-He is 16... how does he even know what love is all about or have the life experience to back it up?
Also... just cause guys call him g*y in no way means that they are jealous of Justin Bieber, we just don't see what the big deal with him is... also all the Justine Bieber fans who were upset about Arcade Fire getting best album at the Grammy's instead of Justin Bieber needs to calm. If you haven't heard Arcade Fire's album and you don't know it... then don't complain that J.B. should have won.... We've heard his stuff and don't like it... might as well widen your musical boundaries a little, eh? (I'm from Michigan, not Canada)
Anyway that's my reasoning... agree with me or not, that's just how I feel.
1) he HAS hit puberty. listen to his recent songs
4) he got a haircut and he looks soo much better
Back to the subject. he has completed more things already than most people do in their life time! And its just the beginning
And by the way EVERY sing guy in this world thinks about girls and wants girls. Hes just like every other guy.
I'm a girl but I don't like him that much.
1. He hasn't got puberty and he's 16.
2. If he still hasn't got it, he acts like he's 20 and sings about girls which is annoying and weird for his age type.
3. He has only girl fans OBVIOUSLY. Only 1 or 2 boys around the world or even none like him. He is unpopular and people are his fans cause they way he looks. DUMB.
5. He doesn't have a sponser. He should be by disney or something.
The reasons could be as many as you can just think about because when you are drawing others fan's towards you then must definitely the competitive environment will be alarmingly high and same goes here with Justin Drew Bieber.
2 you hear him every freaking day on a commercial he reminds me of a girl singer or alvin and the chipmunks
3 i dont really hate g**s but can you compare the way they talk act and what they sound like and they share many similarities?
4why do you even like him? he doesnt look hot. he thinks he can rap with people who can. i respect real rappers. if i were him i would be imbarrassed to try to be a rapper even though im not that good at rapping.
i think i have made my point i dont hate him,its just i think he is making so many wrong choices leading him in random success
People are annoying. Don't listen to them. Guys do it cause their just JEALOUS of him and his sexiness, hotness, and his hair. They just call him that because of those things. THEY MAKE ME MADDDDD!
4 reasons why people hate justin bieber.
He has the voice of a chipmunk.
we are not JEALOUS because he has no talent so wat is there to be jealous of??
that is why i hate justin bieber.
h**l if I know if he is g*y or not, just a little bit odd. Mostly I just hate his music, a bunch of sing-about-love stuff again. I get enough of that from way to many places. But I, in general, hate alot of what play on a couple radio stations around me, so its not really targeted right at beiber.
His music is symbolic of the complete commercialization of modern pop music.
It's music made simply for a quick profit.
If you like it you've never listened to real music made for the purpose of sounding good.
Why dont you just become a walking billboard for pepsi and get it over with?
g*y is used as a derrogatory term which is not the same as homosexual.
i dont think he is g*y i just dont like the fact he didnt have to work to become famous.
Boys think Justin is g*y because they are attracted to him. Girls like Bieber because he appears to be gentle and delicate in handling women. All of you haters die with agonizing pain of jealousy, none of you can do any harm to how females think of him. Learn to respect people and mean it from the heart, you might also get someone to like you.
